<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is because I have found that children love
Stockton’s stories, that they appreciate the
delicate bits of humor found in them, and enjoy
discussing the ethical questions suggested,
that I have arranged in this book a few of the
favorites, easily read by children from eight to
ten years of age.</p>

<p>I believe, also, that children can best learn to
read by reading what is best in literature.</p>

<p>This little volume, then, is the result of repeated
tests with children of various ability in
the reading of Stockton’s stories. The results
proved that the language is simple and childlike,
the thought natural, and the story itself
intensely interesting.</p>

<p>Notes and suggestive questions for each
story, except “The Christmas Truants,” which
is so simple that it does not seem to need them,
are given at the end of the book. These, it is
believed, will be found helpful to the teacher
and pupil and aid in securing the best results.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Joy</span> as a factor in education is too apt to be
ignored. Feeling and pleasure are too often
counted out as not being related to the needs
of the child. Good-natured merriment is
hushed. School is invested with a school-consciousness,
an insupportable dryness and
solemnity which precludes the spontaneous
laughter of a normal growth. Discipline is
enforced by direct didactic teaching or through
sarcasm rather than encouraged by the fun
which has no sting in it.</p>

<p>There is no writer before the public who has
added more to the wholesome humor of the
age than Mr. Stockton—no writer whose stories
are so full of pure wit, entirely free from poison,
and pointing to healthy, happy action,
while probing false sentiment. What child
could fail to raise his own standard and guard
himself against egotism after following Arla
through her trials in attempting to regulate
the Clocks of Rondaine? What boy could fail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span>
to appreciate the sweetness and quiet in the
character of the Minor Canon?</p>

<p>Every school would be the better for such
reading. The notes from the pipes of “Old
Pipes” come floating down to me from the
happy reading lessons of years ago, when my
own pupils loved to read the story. What a
happy mood it threw over the school-room!
It is the realization of a long hope that one of
my pupils has selected this story as one that
ought to come into an inexpensive school-book
where children in general may enjoy it. And
why should not children have such reading,
and have it related to school work? Why
should the librarian at the public library be the
real teacher of reading, the one to whom children
go to get what they like and want? Why
should the public library instead of the school-room
be the literary resort for children? Why
should not the children, who form the best part
of the “reading public,” be in intimate relation
to the literary life of their land? Why should
they not get at the man who sings out of his
heart because he has something to sing? What
would it mean to the children of the United
States if all the reading-books gotten up for
commercial purposes were swept out of existence
and the works of good writers substituted?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</span>
What would it mean to the public?
What, to teachers, authors, publishers? To
the child it would mean stores and stores of
knowledge, contact with the best life agoing,
the conservation of his youth, economy of his
time. To the public it would mean a more intelligent
citizenship, a happier people, the raising
of the general taste. To the teacher it
would mean relief from the drudgery of trying
to make something seem good and interesting
that is often poor and inane. To the author it
would mean an audience of thousands where
he is now heard by one. To the publisher it
would mean the delight of knowing himself to
be patriotically related to the public.</p>

<p>Success to the little book, “Fanciful Tales”!
May it be followed by companions from the
best authors of the country, until there is a
complete set of “reading-books,” and the literary
life of the land is the common condition of
people, and our best writers are as well known
to the millions as they are now to the few
thousands who form the reading public.</p>

<p class="ph2">FANCIFUL TALES</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">OLD PIPES AND THE DRYAD</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A mountain</span> brook ran through a little village.
Over the brook there was a narrow
bridge, and from the bridge a foot-path led
out from the village and up the hill-side, to
the cottage of Old Pipes and his mother.</p>

<p>For many, many years Old Pipes had been
employed by the villagers to pipe the cattle
down from the hills. Every afternoon, an hour
before sunset, he would sit on a rock in front
of his cottage and play on his pipes. Then
all the flocks and herds that were grazing on
the mountains would hear him, wherever they
might happen to be, and would come down to the
village—the cows by the easiest paths, the sheep
by those not quite so easy, and the goats by the
steep and rocky ways that were hardest of all.</p>

<p>But now, for a year or more, Old Pipes had
not piped the cattle home. It is true that
every afternoon he sat upon the rock and
played upon his pipes; but the cattle did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
hear him. He had grown old, and his breath
was feeble. The echoes of his cheerful notes,
which used to come from the rocky hill on the
other side of the valley, were heard no more;
and twenty yards from Old Pipes one could
scarcely tell what tune he was playing. He
had become somewhat deaf, and did not know
that the sound of his pipes was so thin and
weak, and that the cattle did not hear him.
The cows, the sheep, and the goats came down
every afternoon as before; but this was because
two boys and a girl were sent up after them.
The villagers did not wish the good old man to
know that his piping was no longer of any use;
so they paid him his little salary every month,
and said nothing about the two boys and the
girl.</p>

<p>Old Pipes’s mother was, of course, a great
deal older than he was, and was as deaf as a
gate—posts, latch, hinges, and all—and she
never knew that the sound of her son’s pipe
did not spread over all the mountain-side and
echo back strong and clear from the opposite
hills. She was very fond of Old Pipes, and
proud of his piping; and as he was so much
younger than she was, she never thought of
him as being very old. She cooked for him,
and made his bed, and mended his clothes;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
and they lived very comfortably on his little
salary.</p>

<p>One afternoon, at the end of the month,
when Old Pipes had finished his piping, he took
his stout staff and went down the hill to the
village to receive the money for his month’s
work. The path seemed a great deal steeper
and more difficult than it used to be; and Old
Pipes thought that it must have been washed
by the rains and greatly damaged. He remembered
it as a path that was quite easy to
traverse either up or down. But Old Pipes
had been a very active man, and as his mother
was so much older than he was, he never
thought of himself as aged and infirm.</p>

<p>When the Chief Villager had paid him, and
he had talked a little with some of his friends,
Old Pipes started to go home. But when he
had crossed the bridge over the brook, and
gone a short distance up the hill-side, he became
very tired, and sat down upon a stone. He
had not been sitting there half a minute, when
along came two boys and a girl.</p>

<p>“Children,” said Old Pipes, “I’m very tired
to-night, and I don’t believe I can climb up this
steep path to my home. I think I shall have to
ask you to help me.”</p>

<p>“We will do that,” said the boys and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
girl, quite cheerfully; and one boy took him
by the right hand and the other by the left,
while the girl pushed him in the back. In this
way he went up the hill quite easily, and soon
reached his cottage door. Old Pipes gave
each of the three children a copper coin, and
then they sat down for a few minutes’ rest before
starting back to the village.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry that I tired you so much,” said
Old Pipes.</p>

<p>“Oh, that would not have tired us,” said one
of the boys, “if we had not been so far to-day
after the cows, the sheep, and the goats. They
rambled high up on the mountain, and we never
before had such a time in finding them.”</p>

<p>“Had to go after the cows, the sheep, and
the goats!” exclaimed Old Pipes. “What do
you mean by that?”</p>

<p>The girl, who stood behind the old man,
shook her head, put her hand on her mouth,
and made all sorts of signs to the boy to stop
talking on this subject; but he did not notice
her, and promptly answered Old Pipes.</p>

<p>“Why, you see, good sir,” said he, “that as
the cattle can’t hear your pipes now, somebody
has to go after them every evening to
drive them down from the mountain, and the
Chief Villager has hired us three to do it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
Generally it is not very hard work, but to-night
the cattle had wandered far.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been doing this?”
asked the old man.</p>

<p>The girl shook her head and clapped her hand
on her mouth as before, but the boy went on.</p>

<p>“I think it is about a year now,” he said,
“since the people first felt sure that the cattle
could not hear your pipes; and from that time
we’ve been driving them down. But we are
rested now, and will go home. Good-night,
sir.”</p>

<p>The three children then went down the hill,
the girl scolding the boy all the way home.
Old Pipes stood silent a few moments, and then
he went into his cottage.</p>

<p>“Mother,” he shouted, “did you hear what
those children said?”</p>

<p>“Children!” exclaimed the old woman; “I
did not hear them. I did not know there were
any children here.”</p>

<p>Then Old Pipes told his mother—shouting
very loudly to make her hear—how the two
boys and the girl had helped him up the hill,
and what he had heard about his piping and
the cattle.</p>

<p>“They can’t hear you?” cried his mother.
“Why, what’s the matter with the cattle?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>“Ah, me!” said Old Pipes; “I don’t believe
there’s anything the matter with the cattle.
It must be with me and my pipes that there
is something the matter. But one thing is
certain: if I do not earn the wages the Chief
Villager pays me, I shall not take them. I
shall go straight down to the village and give
back the money I received to-day.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” cried his mother. “I’m sure
you’ve piped as well as you could, and no more
can be expected. And what are we to do without
the money?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Old Pipes; “but I’m
going down to the village to pay it back.”</p>

<p>The sun had now set; but the moon was
shining very brightly on the hill-side, and Old
Pipes could see his way very well. He did
not take the same path by which he had gone
before, but followed another, which led among
the trees upon the hill-side, and, though longer,
was not so steep.</p>

<p>When he had gone about half-way, the old
man sat down to rest, leaning his back against
a great oak tree. As he did so, he heard a
sound like knocking inside the tree, and then
a voice said:</p>

<p>“Let me out! let me out!”</p>

<p>Old Pipes instantly forgot that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
tired, and sprang to his feet. “This must be a
Dryad tree!” he exclaimed. “If it is, I’ll let
her out.”</p>

<p>Old Pipes had never, to his knowledge, seen
a Dryad tree, but he knew there were such
trees on the hill-sides and the mountains, and
that Dryads lived in them. He knew, too, that
in the summer-time, on those days when the
moon rose before the sun went down, a Dryad
could come out of her tree if anyone could
find the key which locked her in, and turn it.
Old Pipes closely examined the trunk of the
tree, which stood in the full moonlight. “If
I see that key,” he said, “I shall surely turn
it.” Before long he found a piece of bark
standing out from the tree, which looked to
him very much like the handle of a key. He
took hold of it, and found he could turn it
quite around. As he did so, a large part of
the side of the tree was pushed open, and a
beautiful Dryad stepped quickly out.</p>

<p>For a moment she stood motionless, gazing
on the scene before her—the tranquil valley,
the hills, the forest, and the mountain-side, all
lying in the soft clear light of the moon. “Oh,
lovely! lovely!” she exclaimed. “How long
it is since I have seen anything like this!”
And then, turning to Old Pipes, she said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
“How good of you to let me out! I am so
happy, and so thankful, that I must kiss you,
you dear old man!” And she threw her arms
around the neck of Old Pipes, and kissed him
on both cheeks.</p>

<p>“You don’t know,” she then went on to say,
“how doleful it is to be shut up so long in a tree.
I don’t mind it in the winter, for then I am glad
to be sheltered, but in summer it is a rueful
thing not to be able to see all the beauties of
the world. And it’s ever so long since I’ve
been let out. People so seldom come this way;
and when they do come at the right time, they
either don’t hear me or they are frightened
and run away. But you, you dear old man,
you were not frightened, and you looked and
looked for the key, and you let me out; and
now I shall not have to go back till winter has
come, and the air grows cold. Oh, it is glorious!
What can I do for you, to show you how
grateful I am?”</p>

<p>“I am very glad,” said Old Pipes, “that I let
you out, since I see that it makes you so happy;
but I must admit that I tried to find the key
because I had a great desire to see a Dryad.
But, if you wish to do something for me, you
can, if you happen to be going down toward
the village.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“To the village!” exclaimed the Dryad. “I
will go anywhere for you, my kind old benefactor.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Old Pipes, “I wish you
would take this little bag of money to the Chief
Villager and tell him that Old Pipes cannot
receive pay for the services which he does not
perform. It is now more than a year that I have
not been able to make the cattle hear me, when
I piped to call them home. I did not know this
until to-night; but now that I know it, I cannot
keep the money, and so I send it back.” And,
handing the little bag to the Dryad, he bade her
good-night, and turned toward his cottage.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” said the Dryad. “And I
thank you over, and over, and over again, you
good old man!”</p>

<p>Old Pipes walked toward his home, very
glad to be saved the fatigue of going all the
way down to the village and back again. “To
be sure,” he said to himself, “this path does
not seem at all steep, and I can walk along it
very easily; but it would have tired me dreadfully
to come up all the way from the village,
especially as I could not have expected those
children to help me again.” When he reached
home his mother was surprised to see him returning
so soon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“What!” she exclaimed; “have you already
come back? What did the Chief Villager say?
Did he take the money?”</p>

<p>Old Pipes was just about to tell her that he
had sent the money to the village by a Dryad,
when he suddenly reflected that his mother
would be sure to disapprove such a proceeding,
and so he merely said he had sent it by
a person whom he had met.</p>

<p>“And how do you know that the person will
ever take it to the Chief Villager?” cried his
mother. “You will lose it, and the villagers
will never get it. Oh, Pipes! Pipes! when
will you be old enough to have ordinary common-sense?”</p>

<p>Old Pipes considered that, as he was already
seventy years of age, he could scarcely expect
to grow any wiser; but he made no remark
on this subject, and, saying that he doubted
not that the money would go safely to its destination,
he sat down to his supper. His mother
scolded him roundly, but he did not mind it;
and after supper he went out and sat on a rustic
chair in front of the cottage to look at the
moonlit village, and to wonder whether or not
the Chief Villager really received the money.
While he was doing these two things, he went
fast asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>When Old Pipes left the Dryad, she did not
go down to the village with the little bag of
money. She held it in her hand, and thought
about what she had heard. “This is a good
and honest old man,” she said; “and it is a
shame that he should lose this money. He
looked as if he needed it, and I don’t believe
the people in the village will take it from one
who has served them so long. Often, when in
my tree, have I heard the sweet notes of his
pipes. I am going to take the money back to
him.” She did not start immediately, because
there were so many beautiful things to look
at; but after awhile she went up to the cottage,
and, finding Old Pipes asleep in his chair,
she slipped the little bag into his coat-pocket,
and silently sped away.</p>

<p>The next day Old Pipes told his mother that
he would go up the mountain and cut some
wood. He had a right to get wood from the
mountain, but for a long time he had been content
to pick up the dead branches which lay
about his cottage. To-day, however, he felt so
strong and vigorous that he thought he would
go and cut some fuel that would be better than
this. He worked all the morning, and when
he came back he did not feel at all tired, and
he had a very good appetite for his dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>Now, Old Pipes knew a good deal about
Dryads; but there was one thing which, although
he had heard, he had forgotten. This
was, that a kiss from a Dryad made a person
ten years younger.</p>

<p>The people of the village knew this, and they
were very careful not to let any child of ten
years or younger go into the woods where
the Dryads were supposed to be; for, if they
should chance to be kissed by one of these
tree-nymphs, they would be set back so far
that they would cease to exist.</p>

<p>A story was told in the village that a very
bad boy of eleven once ran away into the woods,
and had an adventure of this kind; and when
his mother found him he was a little baby of
one year old. Taking advantage of her opportunity,
she brought him up more carefully
than she had done before, and he grew to be a
very good boy indeed.</p>

<p>Now Old Pipes had been kissed twice by the
Dryad, once on each cheek, and he therefore
felt as vigorous and active as when he was a
hale man of fifty. His mother noticed how
much work he was doing, and told him that he
need not try in that way to make up for the
loss of his piping wages; for he would only
tire himself out, and get sick. But her son<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
answered that he had not felt so well for years,
and that he was quite able to work.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon, Old Pipes, for
the first time that day, put his hand in his coat-pocket,
and there, to his amazement, he found
the little bag of money. “Well, well!” he exclaimed,
“I am stupid, indeed! I really
thought that I had seen a Dryad; but when I
sat down by that big oak tree I must have gone
to sleep and dreamed it all; and then I came
home, thinking I had given the money to a
Dryad, when it was in my pocket all the time.
But the Chief Villager shall have the money. I
shall not take it to him to-day, but to-morrow I
wish to go to the village to see some of my old
friends; and then I shall give up the money.”</p>

<p>Toward the close of the afternoon, Old Pipes,
as had been his custom for so many years, took
his pipes from the shelf on which they lay, and
went out to the rock in front of the cottage.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” cried his
mother. “If you will not consent to be paid,
why do you pipe?”</p>

<p>“I am going to pipe for my own pleasure,”
said her son. “I am used to it, and I do not
wish to give it up. It does not matter now
whether the cattle hear me or not, and I am
sure that my piping will injure no one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>When the good man began to play upon his
favorite instrument he was astonished at the
sound that came from it. The beautiful notes
of the pipes sounded clear and strong down into
the valley, and spread over the hills, and up the
sides of the mountain beyond, while, after a
little interval, an echo came back from the
rocky hill on the other side of the valley.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” he cried, “what has happened to
my pipes? They must have been stopped up
of late, but now they are as clear and good as
ever.”</p>

<p>Again the merry notes went sounding far and
wide. The cattle on the mountain heard them,
and those that were old enough remembered
how these notes had called them from their
pastures every evening, and so they started
down the mountain-side, the others following.</p>

<p>The merry notes were heard in the village
below, and the people were much astonished
thereby. “Why, who can be blowing the pipes
of Old Pipes?” they said. But, as they were
all very busy, no one went up to see. One
thing, however, was plain enough: the cattle
were coming down the mountain. And so the
two boys and the girl did not have to go after
them, and had an hour for play, for which they
were very glad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>The next morning Old Pipes started down
to the village with his money, and on the way
he met the Dryad. “Oh, ho!” he cried, “is
that you? Why, I thought my letting you
out of the tree was nothing but a dream.”</p>

<p>“A dream!” cried the Dryad; “if you only
knew how happy you have made me, you would
not think it merely a dream. And has it not
benefited you? Do you not feel happier?
Yesterday I heard you playing beautifully on
your pipes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” cried he. “I did not understand
it before, but I see it all now. I have really
grown younger. I thank you, I thank you,
good Dryad, from the bottom of my heart. It
was the finding of the money in my pocket that
made me think it was a dream.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I put it in when you were asleep,” she
said, laughing, “because I thought you ought
to keep it. Good-by, kind, honest man. May
you live long, and be as happy as I am now.”</p>

<p>Old Pipes was greatly delighted when he
understood that he was really a younger man;
but that made no difference about the money,
and he kept on his way to the village. As soon
as he reached it, he was eagerly questioned as
to who had been playing his pipes the evening
before, and when the people heard that it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
himself they were very much surprised. Thereupon
Old Pipes told what had happened to him,
and then there was greater wonder, with hearty
congratulations and hand-shakes; for Old Pipes
was liked by everyone. The Chief Villager
refused to take his money; and although Old
Pipes said that he had not earned it, everyone
present insisted that, as he would now play on
his pipes as before, he should lose nothing
because, for a time, he was unable to perform
his duty.</p>

<p>So Old Pipes was obliged to keep his money,
and after an hour or two spent in conversation
with his friends he returned to his cottage.</p>

<p>There was one person, however, who was not
pleased with what had happened to Old Pipes.
This was an Echo-dwarf who lived on the hills
across the valley. It was his work to echo
back the notes of the pipes whenever they
could be heard.</p>

<p>A great many other Echo-dwarfs lived on
these hills. They all worked, but in different
ways. Some echoed back the songs of maidens,
some the shouts of children, and others the
music that was often heard in the village. But
there was only one who could send back the
strong notes of the pipes of Old Pipes, and this
had been his sole duty for many years. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
when the old man grew feeble, and the notes of
his pipes could not be heard on the opposite
hills, this Echo-dwarf had nothing to do, and he
spent his time in delightful idleness; and he
slept so much and grew so fat that it made his
companions laugh to see him walk.</p>

<p>On the afternoon on which, after so long an interval,
the sound of the pipes was heard on the
echo hills, this dwarf was fast asleep behind a
rock. As soon as the first notes reached them,
some of his companions ran to wake him up.
Rolling to his feet, he echoed back the merry
tune of Old Pipes.</p>

<p>Naturally, he was very angry at being thus
obliged to give up his life of comfort, and he
hoped very much that this pipe-playing would
not occur again. The next afternoon he was
awake and listening, and, sure enough, at the
usual hour, along came the notes of the pipes
as clear and strong as they ever had been; and
he was obliged to work as long as Old Pipes
played. The Echo-dwarf was very angry. He
had supposed, of course, that the pipe-playing
had ceased forever, and he felt that he had a
right to be indignant at being thus deceived.
He was so much disturbed that he made up his
mind to go and try to find out how long this
was to last. He had plenty of time, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
pipes were played but once a day, and he set
off early in the morning for the hill on which
Old Pipes lived. It was hard work for the fat
little fellow, and when he had crossed the valley
and had gone some distance into the woods on
the hill-side, he stopped to rest, and in a few
minutes the Dryad came tripping along.</p>

<p>“Ho, ho!” exclaimed the dwarf; “what are
you doing here? and how did you get out of
your tree?”</p>

<p>“Doing!” cried the Dryad; “I am being
happy; that’s what I am doing. And I was let
out of my tree by the good old man who plays
the pipes to call the cattle down from the
mountain. And it makes me happier to think
that I have been of service to him. I gave him
two kisses of gratitude, and now he is young
enough to play his pipes as well as ever.”</p>

<p>The Echo-dwarf stepped forward, his face
pale with passion, “Am I to believe,” he said,
“that you are the cause of this great evil that
has come upon me? and that you are the
wicked creature who has again started this old
man upon his career of pipe-playing? What
have I ever done to you that you should have
condemned me for years and years to echo
back the notes of those wretched pipes?”</p>

<p>At this the Dryad laughed loudly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“What a funny little fellow you are!” she
said. “Anyone would think you had been
condemned to toil from morning till night;
while what you really have to do is merely to
imitate for half an hour every day the merry
notes of Old Pipes’s piping. Fie upon you,
Echo-dwarf! You are lazy and selfish; and
that is what is the matter with you. Instead of
grumbling at being obliged to do a little wholesome
work, which is less, I am sure, than that
of any other echo-dwarf upon the rocky hill-side,
you should rejoice at the good fortune of
the old man who has regained so much of his
strength and vigor. Go home and learn to be
just and generous; and then, perhaps, you may
be happy. Good-by.”</p>

<p>“Insolent creature!” shouted the dwarf, as
he shook his fat little fist at her. “I’ll make
you suffer for this. You shall find out what it
is to heap injury and insult upon one like me,
and to snatch from him the repose that he has
earned by long years of toil.” And, shaking
his head savagely, he hurried back to the rocky
hill-side.</p>

<p>Every afternoon the merry notes of the pipes
of Old Pipes sounded down into the valley and
over the hills and up the mountain-side; and
every afternoon when he had echoed them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
back, the little dwarf grew more and more
angry with the Dryad. Each day, from early
morning till it was time for him to go back to
his duties upon the rocky hill-side, he searched
the woods for her. He intended, if he met her,
to pretend to be very sorry for what he had
said, and he thought he might be able to play
a trick upon her which would avenge him well.</p>

<p>One day, while thus wandering among the
trees, he met Old Pipes. The Echo-dwarf did
not generally care to see or speak to ordinary
people; but now he was so anxious to find the
object of his search, that he stopped and asked
Old Pipes if he had seen the Dryad. The piper
had not noticed the little fellow, and he looked
down on him with some surprise.</p>

<p>“No,” he said; “I have not seen her, and I
have been looking everywhere for her.”</p>

<p>“You!” cried the dwarf, “what do you wish
with her?”</p>

<p>Old Pipes then sat down on a stone, so that
he should be nearer the ear of his small companion,
and he told what the Dryad had done
for him.</p>

<p>When the Echo-dwarf heard that this was the
man whose pipes he was obliged to echo back
every day, he would have slain him on the spot,
had he been able; but, as he was not able, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
merely ground his teeth and listened to the
rest of the story.</p>

<p>“I am looking for the Dryad now,” Old
Pipes continued, “on account of my aged
mother. When I was old myself, I did not notice
how very old my mother was; but now it
shocks me to see how feeble her years have
caused her to become; and I am looking for
the Dryad to ask her to make my mother
younger, as she made me.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the Echo-dwarf glistened. Here
was a man who might help him in his plans.</p>

<p>“Your idea is a good one,” he said to Old
Pipes, “and it does you honor. But you
should know that a Dryad can make no person
younger but one who lets her out of her tree.
However, you can manage the affair very
easily. All you need do is to find the Dryad,
tell her what you want, and request her to step
into her tree and be shut up for a short time.
Then you will go and bring your mother to
the tree; she will open it, and everything will
be as you wish. Is not this a good plan?”</p>

<p>“Excellent!” cried Old Pipes; “and I will
go instantly and search more diligently for the
Dryad.”</p>

<p>“Take me with you,” said the Echo-dwarf.
“You can easily carry me on your strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
shoulders; and I shall be glad to help you in
any way that I can.”</p>

<p>“Now then,” said the little fellow to himself,
as Old Pipes carried him rapidly along, “if he
persuades the Dryad to get into a tree,—and
she is quite foolish enough to do it,—and then
goes away to bring his mother, I shall take a
stone or a club and I will break off the key of
that tree, so that nobody can ever turn it again.
Then Mistress Dryad will see what she has
brought upon herself by her behavior to me.”</p>

<p>Before long they came to the great oak tree
in which the Dryad had lived, and at a distance
they saw that beautiful creature herself
coming toward them.</p>

<p>“How excellently well everything happens?”
said the dwarf. “Put me down, and I will go.
Your business with the Dryad is more important
than mine; and you need not say anything
about my having suggested your plan to
you. I am willing that you should have all the
credit of it yourself.”</p>

<p>Old Pipes put the Echo-dwarf upon the
ground, but the little rogue did not go away.
He hid himself between some low, mossy rocks,
and he was so much like them in color that you
would not have noticed him if you had been
looking straight at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>When the Dryad came up, Old Pipes lost no
time in telling her about his mother, and what
he wished her to do. At first, the Dryad answered
nothing, but stood looking very sadly
at Old Pipes.</p>

<p>“Do you really wish me to go into my tree
again?” she said. “I should dreadfully dislike
to do it, for I don’t know what might happen.
It is not at all necessary, for I could make your
mother younger at any time if she would give
me the opportunity. I had already thought
of making you still happier in this way, and
several times I have waited about your cottage,
hoping to meet your aged mother, but she
never comes outside, and you know a Dryad
cannot enter a house. I cannot imagine what
put this idea into your head. Did you think of
it yourself?”</p>

<p>“No, I cannot say that I did,” answered Old
Pipes. “A little dwarf whom I met in the
woods proposed it to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried the Dryad; “now I see through
it all. It is the scheme of that vile Echo-dwarf—your
enemy and mine. Where is he? I
should like to see him.”</p>

<p>“I think he has gone away,” said Old Pipes.</p>

<p>“No, he has not,” said the Dryad, whose
quick eyes perceived the Echo-dwarf among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the rocks, “There he is. Seize him and drag
him out, I beg of you.”</p>

<p>Old Pipes saw the dwarf as soon as he was
pointed out to him; and running to the rocks,
he caught the little fellow by the arm and
pulled him out.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” cried the Dryad, who had
opened the door of the great oak, “just stick
him in there, and we will shut him up. Then I
shall be safe from his mischief for the rest of
the time I am free.”</p>

<p>Old Pipes thrust the Echo-dwarf into the
tree; the Dryad pushed the door shut; there
was a clicking sound of bark and wood, and no
one would have noticed that the big oak had
ever had an opening in it.</p>

<p>“There,” said the Dryad; “now we need
not be afraid of him. And I assure you, my
good piper, that I shall be very glad to make
your mother younger as soon as I can. Will
you not ask her to come out and meet me?”</p>

<p>“Of course I will,” cried Old Pipes; “and I
will do it without delay.”</p>

<p>And then, the Dryad by his side, he hurried
to his cottage. But when he mentioned the
matter to his mother, the old woman became
very angry indeed. She did not believe in
Dryads; and, if they really did exist, she knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
they must be witches and sorceresses, and she
would have nothing to do with them. If her
son had ever allowed himself to be kissed by
one of them, he ought to be ashamed of himself.
As to its doing him the least bit of good,
she did not believe a word of it. He felt better
than he used to feel, but that was very common.
She had sometimes felt that way herself, and
she forbade him ever to mention a Dryad to
her again.</p>

<p>That afternoon, Old Pipes, feeling very sad
that his plan in regard to his mother had failed,
sat down upon the rock and played upon his
pipes. The pleasant sounds went down the
valley and up the hills and mountain, but, to
the great surprise of some persons who happened
to notice the fact, the notes were not
echoed back from the rocky hill-side, but from
the woods on the side of the valley on which
Old Pipes lived. The next day many of the
villagers stopped in their work to listen to the
echo of the pipes coming from the woods. The
sound was not as clear and strong as it used to
be when it was sent back from the rocky hill-side,
but it certainly came from among the trees.
Such a thing as an echo changing its place in
this way had never been heard of before, and
nobody was able to explain how it could have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
happened. Old Pipes, however, knew very
well that the sound came from the Echo-dwarf
shut up in the great oak tree. The sides of the
tree were thin, and the sound of the pipes could
be heard through them, and the dwarf was
obliged by the laws of his being to echo back
those notes whenever they came to him. But
Old Pipes thought he might get the Dryad in
trouble if he let anyone know that the Echo-dwarf
was shut up in the tree, and so he wisely
said nothing about it.</p>

<p>One day the two boys and the girl who had
helped Old Pipes up the hill were playing in
the woods. Stopping near the great oak tree,
they heard a sound of knocking within it, and
then a voice plainly said:</p>

<p>“Let me out! let me out!”</p>

<p>For a moment the children stood still in
astonishment, and then one of the boys exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, it is a Dryad, like the one Old Pipes
found! Let’s let her out!”</p>

<p>“What are you thinking of?” cried the girl.
“I am the oldest of all, and I am only thirteen.
Do you wish to be turned into crawling
babies? Run! run! run!”</p>

<p>And the two boys and the girl dashed down
into the valley as fast as their legs could carry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
them. There was no desire in their youthful
hearts to be made younger than they were,
and for fear that their parents might think it
well that they should commence their careers
anew, they never said a word about finding the
Dryad tree.</p>

<p>As the summer days went on, Old Pipes’
mother grew feebler and feebler. One day
when her son was away, for he now frequently
went into the woods to hunt or fish, or down
into the valley to work, she arose from her knitting
to prepare the simple dinner. But she felt
so weak and tired that she was not able to do
the work to which she had been so long accustomed.
“Alas! alas!” she said, “the time has
come when I am too old to work. My son will
have to hire someone to come here and cook
his meals, make his bed, and mend his clothes.
Alas! alas! I had hoped that as long as I lived
I should be able to do these things. But it is
not so. I have grown utterly worthless, and
someone else must prepare the dinner for my
son. I wonder where he is.” And tottering
to the door, she went outside to look for him.
She did not feel able to stand, and reaching the
rustic chair, she sank into it, quite exhausted,
and soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>The Dryad, who had often come to the cottage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
to see if she could find an opportunity
of carrying out Old Pipes’s affectionate design,
now happened by; and seeing that the much-desired
occasion had come, she stepped up
quietly behind the old woman and gently kissed
her on each cheek, and then as quietly disappeared.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the mother of Old Pipes
awoke, and looking up at the sun, she exclaimed:
“Why, it is almost dinner-time! My son will
be here directly, and I am not ready for him.”
And rising to her feet, she hurried into the
house, made the fire, set the meat and vegetables
to cook, laid the cloth, and by the time
her son arrived the meal was on the table.</p>

<p>“How a little sleep does refresh one,” she
said to herself, as she was bustling about. She
was a woman of very vigorous constitution,
and at seventy had been a great deal stronger
and more active than her son was at that age.
The moment Old Pipes saw his mother, he
knew that the Dryad had been there; but,
while he felt as happy as a king, he was too
wise to say anything about her.</p>

<p>“It is astonishing how well I feel to-day,”
said his mother; “and either my hearing has
improved or you speak much more plainly
than you have done of late.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>The summer days went on and passed away,
the leaves were falling from the trees, and the
air was becoming cold.</p>

<p>“Nature has ceased to be lovely,” said the
Dryad, “and the night-winds chill me. It is
time for me to go back into my comfortable
quarters in the great oak. But first I must pay
another visit to the cottage of Old Pipes.”</p>

<p>She found the piper and his mother sitting
side by side on the rock in front of the door.
The cattle were not to go to the mountain any
more that season, and he was piping them down
for the last time. Loud and merrily sounded
the pipes of Old Pipes, and down the mountain-side
came the cattle, the cows by the easiest
paths, the sheep by those not quite so easy,
and the goats by the most difficult ones among
the rocks: while from the great oak tree were
heard the echoes of the cheerful music.</p>

<p>“How happy they look, sitting there together,”
said the Dryad; “and I don’t believe
it will do them a bit of harm to be still younger.”
And moving quietly up behind them, she first
kissed Old Pipes on his cheek and then kissed
his mother.</p>

<p>Old Pipes, who had stopped playing, knew
what it was, but he did not move, and said
nothing. His mother, thinking that her son<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
had kissed her, turned to him with a smile and
kissed him in return. And then she arose and
went into the cottage, a vigorous woman of
sixty, followed by her son, erect and happy, and
twenty years younger than herself.</p>

<p>The Dryad sped away to the woods, shrugging
her shoulders as she felt the cool evening
wind.</p>

<p>When she reached the great oak, she turned
the key and opened the door. “Come out,”
she said to the Echo-dwarf, who sat blinking
within. “Winter is coming on, and I want the
comfortable shelter of my tree for myself. The
cattle have come down from the mountain for
the last time this year, the pipes will no longer
sound, and you can go to your rocks and have
a holiday until next spring.”</p>

<p>Upon hearing these words the dwarf skipped
quickly out, and the Dryad entered the tree
and pulled the door shut after her. “Now,
then,” she said to herself, “he can break off the
key if he likes. It does not matter to me.
Another will grow out next spring. And although
the good piper made me no promise,
I know that when the warm days arrive next
year, he will come and let me out again.”</p>

<p>The Echo-dwarf did not stop to break the
key of the tree. He was too happy to be released<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
to think of anything else, and he hastened
as fast as he could to his home on the rocky
hill-side.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Dryad was not mistaken when she trusted
in the piper. When the warm days came again
he went to the oak tree to let her out. But, to
his sorrow and surprise, he found the great
tree lying upon the ground. A winter storm
had blown it down, and it lay with its trunk
shattered and split. And what became of the
Dryad no one ever knew.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE BEE-MAN OF ORN</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the ancient country of Orn there lived an
old man who was called the Bee-man, because
his whole time was spent in the company of
bees. He lived in a small hut, which was
nothing more than an immense bee-hive, for
these little creatures had built their honey-combs
in every corner of the one room it contained,
on the shelves, under the little table,
all about the rough bench on which the old
man sat, and even about the head-board and
along the sides of his low bed.</p>

<p>All day the air of the room was thick with
buzzing insects, but this did not interfere in
any way with the old Bee-man, who walked in
among them, ate his meals, and went to sleep,
without the slightest fear of being stung.</p>

<p>He had lived with the bees so long, they
had become so accustomed to him, and his skin
was so tough and hard, that the bees no more
thought of stinging him than they would of
stinging a tree or a stone. A swarm of bees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
had made their hive in a pocket of his old
leathern doublet; and when he put on this
coat to take one of his long walks in the forest
in search of wild bees’ nests, he was very glad
to have this hive with him, for, if he did not
find any wild honey, he would put his hand in
his pocket and take out a piece of a comb for a
luncheon. The bees in his pocket worked very
industriously, and he was always certain of
having something to eat with him wherever he
went. He lived principally upon honey; and
when he needed bread or meat, he carried
some fine combs to a village not far away and
bartered them for other food. He was ugly,
untidy, shrivelled, and brown. He was poor,
and the bees seemed to be his only friends.
But, for all that, he was happy and contented;
he had all the honey he wanted, and his bees,
whom he considered the best company in the
world, were as friendly and sociable as they
could be, and seemed to increase in number
every day.</p>

<p>One day there stopped at the hut of the Bee-man
a Junior Sorcerer. This young person,
who was a student of magic, was much interested
in the Bee-man, whom he had often
noticed in his wanderings, and he considered
him an admirable subject for study. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
got a great deal of useful practice by trying
to find out, by the various rules and laws of
sorcery, exactly why the old Bee-man did not
happen to be something that he was not, and
why he was what he happened to be. He had
studied a long time at this matter, and had
found out something.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” he said, when the Bee-man
came out of his hut, “that you have been transformed?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” said the
other, much surprised.</p>

<p>“You have surely heard of animals and
human beings who have been magically transformed
into different kinds of creatures?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have heard of these things,” said the
Bee-man; “but what have I been transformed
from?”</p>

<p>“That is more than I know,” said the Junior
Sorcerer. “But one thing is certain: you
ought to be changed back. If you will find
out what you have been transformed from, I
will see that you are made all right again.
Nothing would please me better than to attend
to such a case.”</p>

<p>And, having a great many things to study
and investigate, the Junior Sorcerer went his
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>This information greatly disturbed the mind
of the Bee-man. If he had been changed from
something else, he ought to be that other thing,
whatever it was. He ran after the young man,
and overtook him.</p>

<p>“If you know, kind sir,” he said, “that I have
been transformed, you surely are able to tell
me what it is that I was.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the Junior Sorcerer, “my studies
have not proceeded far enough for that. When
I become a senior I can tell you all about it.
But, in the meantime, it will be well for you to
try to find out for yourself your original form;
and when you have done that, I will get some
of the learned masters of my art to restore you
to it. It will be easy enough to do that, but
you could not expect them to take the time
and trouble to find out what it was.”</p>

<p>And, with these words, he hurried away, and
was soon lost to view.</p>

<p>Greatly disturbed, the Bee-man retraced his
steps, and went to his hut. Never before had
he heard anything which had so troubled him.</p>

<p>“I wonder what I was transformed from?”
he thought, seating himself on his rough bench.
“Could it have been a giant, or a powerful
prince, or some gorgeous being whom the magicians
or the fairies wished to punish? It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
may be that I was a dog or a horse, or perhaps
a fiery dragon or a horrid snake. I hope it
was not one of these. But whatever it was,
everyone has certainly a right to his original
form, and I am resolved to find out mine. I
will start early to-morrow morning; and I am
sorry now that I have not more pockets to my
old doublet, so that I might carry more bees
and more honey for my journey.”</p>

<p>He spent the rest of the day in making a hive
of twigs and straw; and, having transferred
to this a number of honey-combs and a colony
of bees which had just swarmed, he rose before
sunrise the next day, and having put on his
leathern doublet, and having bound his new
hive to his back, he set forth on his quest, the
bees who were to accompany him buzzing
around him like a cloud.</p>

<p>As the Bee-man pressed through the little
village the people greatly wondered at his
queer appearance, with the hive upon his back.
“The Bee-man is going on a long journey this
time,” they said; but no one imagined the
strange business on which he was bent. About
noon he sat down under a tree, near a beautiful
meadow covered with blossoms, and ate a
little honey. Then he untied his hive and
stretched himself out on the grass to rest. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
he gazed upon his bees hovering about him,
some going out to the blossoms in the sunshine,
and some returning laden with the sweet pollen,
he said to himself, “They know just what
they have to do, and they do it; but alas for
me! I know not what I may have to do. And
yet, whatever it may be, I am determined to do
it. In some way or other I will find out what
was my original form, and then I will have
myself changed back to it.”</p>

<p>And now the thought came to him that perhaps
his original form might have been something
very disagreeable, or even horrid.</p>

<p>“But it does not matter,” he said sturdily.
“Whatever I was that shall I be again. It is
not right for anyone to keep a form which does
not properly belong to him. I have no doubt
I shall discover my original form in the same
way that I find the trees in which the wild bees
hive. When I first catch sight of a bee tree I
am drawn toward it, I know not how. Something
says to me: ‘That is what you are looking
for.’ In the same way I believe that I shall
find my original form. When I see it, I shall
be drawn toward it. Something will say to
me: ‘That is it.’”</p>

<p>When the Bee-man was rested he started off
again, and in about an hour he entered a fair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
domain. Around him were beautiful lawns,
grand trees, and lovely gardens; while at a
little distance stood the stately palace of the
Lord of the Domain. Richly dressed people
were walking about or sitting in the shade
of the trees and arbors; splendidly equipped
horses were waiting for their riders; and everywhere
were seen signs of wealth and gayety.</p>

<p>“I think,” said the Bee-man to himself, “that
I should like to stop here for a time. If it
should happen that I was originally like any of
these happy creatures it would please me much.”</p>

<p>He untied his hive, and hid it behind some
bushes, and, taking off his old doublet, laid that
beside it. It would not do to have his bees flying
about him if he wished to go among the
inhabitants of this fair domain.</p>

<p>For two days the Bee-man wandered about
the palace and its grounds, avoiding notice as
much as possible, but looking at everything.
He saw handsome men and lovely ladies; the
finest horses, dogs, and cattle that were ever
known; beautiful birds in cages, and fishes in
crystal globes: and it seemed to him that the
best of all living things were here collected.</p>

<p>At the close of the second day the Bee-man
said to himself: “There is one being here toward
whom I feel very much drawn, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
is the Lord of the Domain. I cannot feel
certain that I was once like him, but it would
be a very fine thing if it were so; and it seems
impossible for me to be drawn toward any
other being in the domain when I look upon
him, so handsome, rich, and powerful. But I
must observe him more closely, and feel more
sure of the matter, before applying to the sorcerers
to change me back into a lord of a fair
domain.”</p>

<p>The next morning the Bee-man saw the Lord
of the Domain walking in his gardens. He
slipped along the shady paths, and followed
him so as to observe him closely, and find out
if he were really drawn toward this noble and
handsome being. The Lord of the Domain
walked on for some time, not noticing that
the Bee-man was behind him. But suddenly
turning, he saw the little old man.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here, you vile beggar?”
he cried, and he gave him a kick that
sent him into some bushes that grew by the
side of the path.</p>

<p>The Bee-man scrambled to his feet, and ran
as fast as he could to the place where he had
hidden his hive and his old doublet.</p>

<p>“If I am certain of anything,” he thought,
“it is that I was never a person who would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
kick a poor old man. I will leave this place.
I was transformed from nothing that I see
here.”</p>

<p>He now travelled for a day or two longer,
and then he came to a great black mountain,
near the bottom of which was an opening like
the mouth of a cave.</p>

<p>This mountain he had heard was filled with
caverns and underground passages, which were
the abodes of dragons, evil spirits, horrid creatures
of all kinds.</p>

<p>“Ah me!” said the Bee-man with a sigh, “I
suppose I ought to visit this place. If I am going
to do this thing properly, I should look on
all sides of the subject, and I may have been
one of those horrid creatures myself.”</p>

<p>Thereupon he went to the mountain, and,
as he approached the opening of the passage
which led into its inmost recesses, he saw, sitting
upon the ground, and leaning his back
against a tree, a Languid Youth.</p>

<p>“Good-day,” said this individual when he
saw the Bee-man. “Are you going inside?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Bee-man, “that is what I intend
to do.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the Languid Youth, slowly
rising to his feet, “I think I will go with you.
I was told that if I went in there I should get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
my energies toned up, and they need it very
much; but I did not feel equal to entering by
myself, and I thought I would wait until some
one came along. I am very glad to see you,
and we will go in together.”</p>

<p>So the two went into the cave, and they had
proceeded but a short distance when they met
a very little creature, whom it was easy to recognize
as a Very Imp. He was about two feet
high, and resembled in color a freshly polished
pair of boots. He was extremely lively and active,
and came bounding toward them.</p>

<p>“What did you two people come here for?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“I came,” said the Languid Youth, “to have
my energies toned up.”</p>

<p>“You have come to the right place,” said the
Very Imp. “We will tone you up. And what
does that old Bee-man want?”</p>

<p>“He has been transformed from something,
and wants to find out what it is. He thinks he
may have been one of the things in here.”</p>

<p>“I should not wonder if that were so,” said
the Very Imp, rolling his head on one side, and
eying the Bee-man with a critical gaze.</p>

<p>“All right,” said the Very Imp; “he can go
around, and pick out his previous existence.
We have here all sorts of vile creepers, crawlers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
hissers, and snorters. I suppose he thinks
anything will be better than a Bee-man.”</p>

<p>“It is not because I want to be better than I
am,” said the Bee-man, “that I started out on
this search. I have simply an honest desire to
become what I originally was.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that is it, is it?” said the other.
“There is an idiotic moon-calf here with a clam
head, which must be just like what you used
to be.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said the Bee-man. “You have
not the least idea what an honest purpose is. I
shall go about and see for myself.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said the Very Imp, “and I will
attend to this fellow who wants to be toned
up.” So saying he joined the Languid Youth.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said the Youth, “do you black
and shine yourself every morning?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the other, “it is water-proof varnish.
You want to be invigorated, don’t you?
Well, I will tell you a splendid way to begin.
You see that Bee-man has put down his
hive and his coat with the bees in it. Just
wait till he gets out of sight, and then catch
a lot of those bees, and squeeze them flat.
If you spread them on a sticky rag, and
make a plaster, and put it on the small of
your back, it will invigorate you like everything,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
especially if some of the bees are not
quite dead.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Languid Youth, looking at
him with his mild eyes, “but if I had energy
enough to catch a bee I would be satisfied.
Suppose you catch a lot for me.”</p>

<p>“The subject is changed,” said the Very Imp.
“We are now about to visit the spacious chamber
of the King of the Snap-dragons.”</p>

<p>“That is a flower,” said the Languid Youth.</p>

<p>“You will find him a gay old blossom,” said
the other. “When he has chased you round
his room, and has blown sparks at you, and has
snorted and howled, and cracked his tail, and
snapped his jaws like a pair of anvils, your energies
will be toned up higher than ever before
in your life.”</p>

<p>“No doubt of it,” said the Languid Youth;
“but I think I will begin with something a
little milder.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said the other, “there is a flat-tailed
Demon of the Gorge in here. He is
generally asleep, and, if you say so, you can slip
into the farthest corner of his cave, and I’ll
solder his tail to the opposite wall. Then
he will rage and roar, but he can’t get at
you, for he doesn’t reach all the way across
his cave; I have measured him. It will tone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
you up wonderfully to sit there and watch
him.”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” said the Languid Youth; “but
I would rather stay outside and let you go up
in the corner. The performance in that way
will be more interesting to me.”</p>

<p>“You are dreadfully hard to please,” said the
Very Imp. “I have offered them to you loose,
and I have offered them fastened to a wall, and
now the best thing I can do is to give you a
chance at one of them that can’t move at all.
It is the Ghastly Griffin, and is enchanted. He
can’t stir so much as the tip of his whiskers
for a thousand years. You can go to his cave
and examine him just as if he were stuffed, and
then you can sit on his back and think how it
would be if you should live to be a thousand
years old, and he should wake up while you are
sitting there. It would be easy to imagine a
lot of horrible things he would do to you when
you look at his open mouth with its awful fangs,
his dreadful claws, and his horrible wings all
covered with spikes.”</p>

<p>“I think that might suit me,” said the Languid
Youth. “I would much rather imagine
the exercises of these monsters than to see them
really going on.”</p>

<p>“Come on, then,” said the Very Imp, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
he led the way to the cave of the Ghastly
Griffin.</p>

<p>The Bee-man went by himself through a
great part of the mountain, and looked into
many of its gloomy caves and recesses, recoiling
in horror from most of the dreadful monsters
who met his eyes. While he was wandering
about, an awful roar was heard resounding
through the passages of the mountain, and soon
there came flapping along an enormous dragon,
with body black as night, and wings and tail of
fiery red. In his great fore-claws he bore a
little baby.</p>

<p>“Horrible!” exclaimed the Bee-man. “He
is taking that little creature to his cave to
devour it.”</p>

<p>He saw the dragon enter a cave not far
away, and, following, looked in. The dragon
was crouched upon the ground with the little
baby lying before him. It did not seem to be
hurt, but was frightened and crying. The
monster was looking upon it with delight, as if
he intended to make a dainty meal of it as soon
as his appetite should be a little stronger.</p>

<p>“It is too bad!” thought the Bee-man.
“Somebody ought to do something.” And
turning around, he ran away as fast as he
could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>He ran through various passages until he
came to the spot where he had left his bee-hive.
Picking it up, he hurried back, carrying the
hive in his two hands before him. When he
reached the cave of the dragon, he looked in
and saw the monster still crouched over the
weeping child. Without a moment’s hesitation,
the Bee-man rushed into the cave and
threw his hive straight into the face of the dragon.
The bees, enraged by the shock, rushed
out in an angry crowd and immediately fell
upon the head, mouth, eyes, and nose of the
dragon. The great monster, astounded by this
sudden attack, and driven almost wild by the
numberless stings of the bees, sprang back to
the farthest corner of his cave, still followed by
the bees, at whom he flapped wildly with his
great wings and struck with his paws. While
the dragon was thus engaged with the bees,
the Bee-man rushed forward, and, seizing the
child, he hurried away. He did not stop to
pick up his doublet, but kept on until he
reached the entrance of the cave. There he
saw the Very Imp hopping along on one leg,
and rubbing his back and shoulders with his
hands, and stopped to inquire what was the
matter, and what had become of the Languid
Youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“He is no kind of a fellow,” said the Very
Imp. “He disappointed me dreadfully. I took
him up to the Ghastly Griffin, and told him the
thing was enchanted, and that he might sit on
its back and think about what it could do if it
was awake; and when he came near it the
wretched creature opened its eyes, and raised
its head, and then you ought to have seen how
mad that simpleton was. He made a dash at
me and seized me by the ears; he kicked and
beat me till I can scarcely move.”</p>

<p>“His energies must have been toned up a
good deal,” said the Bee-man.</p>

<p>“Toned up! I should say so!” cried the
other. “I raised a howl, and a Scissor-jawed
Clipper came out of his hole, and got after
him; but that lazy fool ran so fast that he could
not be caught.”</p>

<p>The Bee-man now ran on and soon overtook
the Languid Youth.</p>

<p>“You need not be in a hurry now,” said the
latter, “for the rules of this institution don’t
allow the creatures inside to come out of this
opening, or to hang around it. If they did,
they would frighten away visitors. They go
in and out of holes in the upper part of the
mountain.”</p>

<p>The two proceeded on their way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“What are you going to do with that baby?”
said the Languid Youth.</p>

<p>“I shall carry it along with me,” said the
Bee-man, “as I go on with my search, and perhaps
I may find its mother. If I do not, I shall
give it to somebody in that little village yonder.
Anything would be better than leaving it to
be devoured by that horrid dragon.”</p>

<p>“Let me carry it. I feel quite strong enough
now to carry a baby.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the Bee-man; “but I can
take it myself. I like to carry something, and
I have now neither my hive nor my doublet.”</p>

<p>“It is very well that you had to leave them
behind,” said the Youth, “for the bees would
have stung the baby.”</p>

<p>“My bees never sting babies,” said the other.</p>

<p>“They probably never had a chance,” remarked
his companion.</p>

<p>They soon entered the village, and after
walking a short distance the Youth exclaimed.
“Do you see that woman over there sitting at
the door of her house? She has beautiful hair,
and she is tearing it all to pieces. She should
not be allowed to do that.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the Bee-man. “Her friends
should tie her hands.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she is the mother of this child,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
said the Youth, “and if you give it to her she
will no longer think of tearing her hair.”</p>

<p>“But,” said the Bee-man, “you don’t really
think this is her child?”</p>

<p>“Suppose you go over and see,” said the
other.</p>

<p>The Bee-man hesitated a moment, and then
he walked toward the woman. Hearing him
coming, she raised her head, and when she saw
the child she rushed toward it, snatched it into
her arms, and screaming with joy she covered
it with kisses. Then with happy tears she
begged to know the story of the rescue of her
child, whom she never expected to see again;
and she loaded the Bee-man with thanks and
blessings. The friends and neighbors gathered
around, and there was great rejoicing. The
mother urged the Bee-man and the Youth to
stay with her, and rest and refresh themselves,
which they were glad to do, as they were tired
and hungry.</p>

<p>They remained at the cottage all night, and in
the afternoon of the next day the Bee-man said
to the Youth: “It may seem an odd thing to
you, but never in all my life have I felt myself
drawn toward any living being as I am drawn
toward this baby. Therefore I believe that I
have been transformed from a baby.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“Good!” cried the Youth. “It is my opinion
that you have hit the truth. And now
would you like to be changed back to your
original form?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I would!” said the Bee-man. “I
have the strongest yearning to be what I originally
was.”</p>

<p>The Youth, who had now lost every trace of
languid feeling, took a great interest in the
matter, and early the next morning started off
to tell the Junior Sorcerer that the Bee-man
had discovered what he had been transformed
from, and desired to be changed back to it.</p>

<p>The Junior Sorcerer and his learned Masters
were filled with delight when they heard this
report, and they at once set out for the mother’s
cottage. And there by magic arts the Bee-man
was changed back into a baby. The mother
was so grateful for what the Bee-man had done
for her that she agreed to take charge of this
baby, and to bring it up as her own.</p>

<p>“It will be a grand thing for him,” said the
Junior Sorcerer, “and I am glad that I studied
his case. He will now have a fresh start in life,
and will have a chance to become something
better than a miserable old man living in a
wretched hut with no friends or companions
but buzzing bees.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>The Junior Sorcerer and his Masters then returned
to their homes, happy in the success of
their great performance; and the Youth went
back to his home anxious to begin a life of activity
and energy.</p>

<p>Years and years afterward, when the Junior
Sorcerer had become a Senior and was very
old indeed, he passed through the country of
Orn, and noticed a small hut about which
swarms of bees were flying. He approached it,
and looking in at the door he saw an old man
in a leathern doublet, sitting at a table, eating
honey. By his magic art he knew this was the
baby which had been transformed from the
Bee-man.</p>

<p>“Upon my word!” exclaimed the Sorcerer,
“he has grown into the same thing again!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE CLOCKS OF RONDAINE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Centuries</span> ago, there stood on the banks of
a river a little town called Rondaine. The
river was a long and winding stream which
ran through different countries, and was sometimes
narrow and swift, and sometimes broad
and placid; sometimes hurrying through
mountain passes, and again meandering quietly
through fertile plains; in some places of a blue
color and almost transparent, and in others of a
dark and sombre hue; and so it changed until
it threw itself into a warm, far-spreading sea.</p>

<p>But it was quite otherwise with the little
town. As far back as anybody could remember,
it had always been the same that it was
at the time of our story; and the people who
lived there could see no reason to suppose that
it would ever be different from what it was
then. It was a pleasant little town, its citizens
were very happy; and why there should be
any change in it, the most astute old man in all
Rondaine could not have told you.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_052fp">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_052fp.jpg" alt="ARLA AND THE SACRISTAN">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">ARLA AND THE SACRISTAN.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>If Rondaine had been famed for anything at
all, it would have been for the number of its
clocks. It had many churches, some little ones
in dark side streets, and some larger ones in
wider avenues, besides here and there a very
good-sized church fronting on a park or open
square; and in the steeple of each of these
churches there was a clock.</p>

<p>There were town buildings, very old ones,
which stood upon the great central square.
Each of these had a tower, and in each tower
was a clock.</p>

<p>Then there were clocks at street corners, and
two clocks in the market-place, and clocks over
shop-doors, a clock at each end of the bridge,
and several large clocks a little way out of
town. Many of these clocks were fashioned in
some quaint and curious way. In one of the
largest a stone man came out and struck the
hours with a stone hammer, while a stone
woman struck the half-hours with a stone
broom; and in another an iron donkey kicked
the hours on a bell behind him.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to tell all the odd
ways in which the clocks of Rondaine struck;
but in one respect they were alike: they all did
strike. The good people of the town would
not have tolerated a clock which did not strike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>It was very interesting to lie awake in the
night and hear the clocks of Rondaine strike.
First would come a faint striking from one of
the churches in the by-streets, a modest sound,
as if the clock was not sure whether it was too
early or not; then from another quarter would
be heard a more confident clock striking the
hour clearly and distinctly.</p>

<p>When they were quite ready, but not a moment
before, the seven bells of the large church
on the square would chime the hour; after
which, at a respectful interval of time, the
other church clocks of the town would strike.
After the lapse of three or four minutes, the
sound of all these bells seemed to wake up the
stone man in the tower of the town-building,
and he struck the hour with his hammer.
When this had been done, the other town-clocks
felt at liberty to strike, and they did so.
And when every sound had died away, so that
he would be certain to be heard if there was
anyone awake to hear, it would be very likely
that the iron donkey would kick out the hour
on his bell. But there were times when he
kicked before any of the clocks began to strike.</p>

<p>One by one the clocks on the street corners
struck, the uptown ones first, and afterward
those near the river. These were followed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
the two clocks on the bridge, the one at the
country end waiting until it was quite sure that
the one at the town end had finished. Somewhat
later would be heard the clock of Vougereau,
an old country-house in the suburbs.
This clock, a very large one, was on the top of
a great square stone tower, and from its age it
had acquired a habit of deliberation; and when
it began to strike people were very apt to think
that it was one o’clock, until after an interval
another stroke would tell them that it was later
or earlier than that, and if they really wanted
to know what hour the old clock was striking
they must give themselves time enough to listen
until they were entirely certain that it had finished.</p>

<p>The very last clock to strike in Rondaine was
one belonging to a little old lady with white
hair, who lived in a little white house in one of
the prettiest and cleanest streets in the town.
Her clock was in a little white tower at the
corner of her house, and was the only strictly
private clock which was in the habit of making
itself publicly heard. Long after every other
clock had struck, and when there was every
reason to believe that for some time nothing but
half-hours would be heard in Rondaine, the old
lady’s clock would strike quickly and with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
tone that said, “I know I am right, and I wish
other people to know it.”</p>

<p>In a small house which stood at a corner of
two streets in the town there lived a young
girl named Arla. For a year or more this
young girl had been in the habit of waking up
very early in the morning, sometimes long before
daylight, and it had become a habit with
her to lie and listen to the clocks. Her room
was at the top of the house, and one of its windows
opened to the west and another to the
south, so that sounds entered from different
quarters. Arla liked to leave these windows
open so that the sounds of the clocks might
come in.</p>

<p>Arla knew every clock by its tone, and she
always made it a point to lie awake until she
was positively sure that the last stroke of the
clock at Vougereau had sounded; but it often
happened that sleep overcame her before she
heard the clock of the little old lady with white
hair. It was so very long to wait for that!</p>

<p>It was not because she wanted to know the
hour that Arla used to lie and listen to the
clocks. She could tell this from her own little
clock in her room. This little clock, which had
been given to her when she was a small girl,
not only struck the hours and half-hours and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
quarter-hours, but there was attached to it a
very pretty contrivance which also told the
time. On the front of the clock, just below the
dial, was a sprig of a rosebush beautifully made
of metal, and on this, just after the hour had
sounded, there was a large green bud; at a
quarter past the hour this bud opened a little,
so that the red petals could be seen; fifteen
minutes later it was a half-blown rose, and at a
quarter of an hour more it was nearly full
blown; just before the hour the rose opened to
its fullest extent, and so remained until the
clock had finished striking, when it immediately
shut up into a great green bud. This clock
was a great delight to Arla; for not only was
it a very pleasant thing to watch the unfolding
of the rose, but it was a continual satisfaction
to her to think that her little clock always told
her exactly what time it was, no matter what
the other clocks of Rondaine might say.</p>

<p>Arla’s father and mother were thrifty, industrious
people, who were very fond of their
daughter, and wished her to grow up a thoughtful,
useful woman. In the very early morning,
listening to the clocks of Rondaine or waiting
for them, Arla did a great deal of thinking;
and it so happened, on the morning of the day
before Christmas, when the stars were bright<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
and the air frosty, and every outside sound
very clear and distinct, that Arla began to think
of something which had never entered her mind
before.</p>

<p>“How in the world,” she said to herself, “do
the people of Rondaine know when it is really
Christmas? Christmas begins as soon as it is
twelve o’clock on Christmas Eve; but as some
of the people depend for the time upon one
clock and some upon others, a great many of
them cannot truly know when Christmas Day
has really begun. Even some of the church
clocks make people think that Christmas has
come, when in reality it is yet the day before.
And not one of them strikes at the right time.
As for that iron donkey, I believe he kicks
whenever he feels like it. And yet there are
people who go by him! I know this, for they
have told me so. But the little old lady with
white hair is worse off than anybody else.
Christmas must always come ever so long before
she knows it.”</p>

<p>With these thoughts on her mind, Arla could
not go to sleep again. She heard all the clocks
strike, and lay awake until her own little clock
told her that she ought to get up. During this
time she had made up her mind what she
should do. There was yet one day before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Christmas; and if the people of the town could
be made to see in what a deplorable condition
they were on account of the difference in their
clocks, they might have time to set the matter
right so that all the clocks should strike the
correct hour, and everybody should know exactly
when Christmas Day began. She was
sure that the citizens had never given this
matter proper thought; and it was quite natural
that such should be the case, for it was not
everyone who was in the habit of lying awake
in the very early morning; and in the daytime,
with all the out-door noises, one could not
hear all the clocks strike in Rondaine. Arla,
therefore, thought that a great deal depended
upon her, who knew exactly how this matter
stood.</p>

<p>When she went down to breakfast she asked
permission of her mother to take a day’s holiday.
As she was a good girl, and never neglected
either her lessons or her tasks, her
mother was quite willing to give her the day
before Christmas in which she could do as she
pleased.</p>

<p>The day was cool, but the sun shone brightly
and the air was pleasant. In the country around
about Rondaine Christmas-time was not a very
cold season. Arla put on a warm jacket and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
pretty blue hood, and started out gayly to
attend to the business in hand.</p>

<p>Everybody in Rondaine knew her father and
mother, and a great many of them knew her,
so there was no reason why she should be
afraid to go where she chose. In one hand she
carried a small covered basket in which she
had placed her rose-clock. The works of this
little clock were regulated by a balance-wheel,
like those of a watch, and therefore it could be
carried about without stopping it.</p>

<p>The first place she visited was the church at
which she and her parents always attended
service. It was a small building in a little
square at the bottom of a hill, and, to reach it,
one had to go down a long flight of stone steps.
When she entered the dimly lighted church,
Arla soon saw the sacristan, a pleasant-faced
little old man whom she knew very well.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, sir,” said she. “Do you
take care of the church clock?”</p>

<p>The sacristan was sweeping the stone pavements
of the church, just inside the door. He
stopped and leaned upon his broom. “Yes,
my little friend,” he said, “I take care of everything
here except the souls of the people.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Arla, “I think you ought
to know that your clock is eleven minutes too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
fast. I came here to tell you that, so that you
might change it, and make it strike properly.”</p>

<p>The sacristan’s eyes began to twinkle. He
was a man of merry mood. “That is very good
of you, little Arla; very good indeed. And,
now that we are about it, isn’t there something
else you would like to change? What do you
say to having these stone pillars put to one
side, so that they may be out of the way of
the people when they come in? Or those great
beams in the roof—they might be turned over,
and perhaps we might find that the upper side
would look fresher than this lower part, which
is somewhat time-stained, as you see? Or, for
the matter of that, what do you say to having
our clock-tower taken down and set out there
in the square before the church-door? Then
short-sighted people could see the time much
better, don’t you think? Now tell me, shall
we do all these things together, wise little
friend?”</p>

<p>A tear or two came into Arla’s eyes, but she
made no answer.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, sir,” she said, and went
away.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” she said to herself as she ran up
the stone steps, “that he thought it would be
too much trouble to climb to the top of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
tower to set the clock right. But that was no
reason why he should make fun of me. I don’t
like him as much as I used to.”</p>

<p>The next church to which Arla went was a
large one, and it was some time before she
could find the sacristan. At last she saw him
in a side chapel at the upper end of the church,
engaged in dusting some old books. He was
a large man, with a red face, and he turned
around quickly, with a stern expression, as she
entered.</p>

<p>“Please, sir,” said Arla, “I came to tell you
that your church clock is wrong. It strikes
from four to six minutes before it ought to;
sometimes the one and sometimes the other. It
should be changed so that it will be sure to
strike at the right time.”</p>

<p>The face of the sacristan grew redder and
twitched visibly at her remark.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I wish?” he almost
shouted in reply.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Arla.</p>

<p>“I wish,” he said, “that you were a boy, so
that I might take you by the collar and soundly
cuff your ears, for coming here to insult an
officer of the church in the midst of his duties!
But, as you are a girl, I can only tell you to go
away from here as rapidly and as quietly as you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
can, or I shall have to put you in the hands of
the church authorities!”</p>

<p>Arla was truly frightened, and although she
did not run—for she knew that would not be
proper in a church—she walked as fast as she
could into the outer air.</p>

<p>“What a bad man,” she then said to herself,
“to be employed in a church! It surely is not
known what sort of a person he is, or he would
not be allowed to stay there a day!”</p>

<p>Arla thought she would not go to any more
churches at present, for she did not know what
sort of sacristans she might find in them.</p>

<p>“When the other clocks in the town all strike
properly,” she thought, “it is most likely they
will see for themselves that their clocks are
wrong, and they will have them changed.”</p>

<p>She now made her way to the great square
of the town, and entered the building at the top
of which stood the stone man with his hammer.
She found the doorkeeper in a little room by
the side of the entrance. She knew where to
go, for she had been there with her mother to
ask permission to go up and see the stone man
strike the hour with his hammer, and the stone
woman strike the half-hour with her broom.</p>

<p>The doorkeeper was a grave, middle-aged
man with spectacles; and, remembering what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
had just happened, Arla thought she would
be careful how she spoke to him.</p>

<p>“If you please, sir,” she said, with a courtesy,
“I should like to say something to you. And
I hope you will not be offended when I tell you
that your clock is not quite right. Your stone
man and your stone woman are both too
slow; they sometimes strike as much as seven
minutes after they ought to strike.”</p>

<p>The grave, middle-aged man looked steadily
at her through his spectacles.</p>

<p>“I thought,” continued Arla, “that if this
should be made known to you, you would have
the works of the stone man and the stone
woman altered so that they might strike at
the right time. They can be heard so far, you
know, that it is very necessary they should not
make mistakes.”</p>

<p>“Child,” said the man, with his spectacles
still steadily fixed on her, “for one hundred
and fifty-seven years the open tower on this
building has stood there. For one hundred
and fifty-seven years the thunder and the lightning
in time of storm have roared and flashed
around it, and the sun in time of fair weather
has shone upon it. In that century and a half
and seven years men and women have lived
and have died, and their children and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
grandchildren and their great-grandchildren,
and even the children of these, have lived
and died after them. Kings and queens have
passed away, one after another; and all things
living have grown old and died, one generation
after another, many times. And yet, through
all these years, that stone man and that stone
woman have stood there, and in storm and in
fair weather, by daylight or in the darkness of
night, they have struck the hours and the half-hours.
Of all things that one hundred and
fifty-seven years ago were able to lift an arm
to strike, they alone are left. And now you, a
child of thirteen, or perhaps fourteen years,
come to me and ask me to change that which
has not been changed for a century and a half
and seven years!”</p>

<p>Arla could answer nothing with those spectacles
fixed upon her. They seemed to glare
more and more as she looked at them. “Good-morning,
sir,” she said, dropping a courtesy
as she moved backward toward the door.
Reaching it, she turned and hurried into the
street.</p>

<p>“If those stone people,” she thought, “have
not been altered in all these years, it is likely
they would now be striking two or three hours
out of the way! But I don’t know. If they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
kept on going slow for more than a century,
they must have come around to the right hour
sometimes. But they will have to strike ever
and ever so much longer before they come
around there again!”</p>

<p>Arla now walked on until she came to a
street corner where a cobbler had a little shop.
In the angle of the wall of the house, at the
height of the second story, was a clock. This
cobbler did not like the confined air and poor
light of his shop, and whenever the weather
allowed he always worked outside on the sidewalk.
To-day, although it was winter, the sun
shone brightly on this side of the street, and he
had put his bench outside, close to his door,
and was sitting there, hard at work. When
Arla stopped before him he looked up and
said, cheerfully:</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mistress Arla. Do you
want them half-soled, or heeled, or a patch
put on the toes?”</p>

<p>“My shoes do not need mending,” said
Arla. “I came to ask you if you could tell
me who has charge of the clock at this corner?”</p>

<p>“I can easily do that,” he said, “for I am the
man. I am paid by the year, for winding it up
and keeping it in order, as much as I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
get for putting the soles, heels, tops, linings,
and buckles on a pair of shoes.”</p>

<p>“Which means making them out and out,”
said Arla.</p>

<p>“You are right,” said he, “and the pay is
not great; but if it were larger, more people
might want it and I might lose it; and if it
were less, how could I afford to do it at all?
So I am satisfied.”</p>

<p>“But you ought not to be entirely satisfied,”
said Arla, “for the clock does not keep good
time. I know when it is striking, for it has a
very jangling sound, and it is the most irregular
clock in Rondaine. Sometimes it strikes as
much as twenty-five minutes after the hour, and
very often it does not strike at all.”</p>

<p>The cobbler looked up at her with a smile.
“I am sorry,” he said, “that it has a jangling
stroke, but the fashioning of clocks is not my
trade, and I could not mend its sound with awl,
hammer, or waxed-end. But it seems to me,
my good maiden, that you never mended a pair
of shoes.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” said Arla; “I should do that
even worse than you would make clocks.”</p>

<p>“Never having mended shoes, then,” said
the cobbler, “you do not know what a grievous
thing it is to have twelve o’clock, or six o’clock,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
or any other hour, in fact, come before you are
ready for it. Now, I don’t mind telling you,
because I know you are too good to spoil the
trade of a hard-working cobbler—and shoemaker
too, whenever he gets the chance to be
one—that when I have promised a customer
that he shall have his shoes or his boots at a
certain time of day, and that time is drawing
near, and the end of the job is still somewhat
distant, then do I skip up the stairway and set
back the hands of the clock according to the
work that has to be done. And when my
customer comes I look up to the clock-face
and I say to him, ‘Glad to see you!’ and
then he will look up at the clock and will
say, ‘Yes, I am a little too soon;’ and then,
as likely as not, he will sit down on the doorstep
here by me and talk entertainingly; and
it may happen that he will sit there without
grumbling for many minutes after the clock
has pointed out the hour at which the shoes
were promised.</p>

<p>“Sometimes, when I have been much belated
in beginning a job, I stop the clock altogether,
for you can well see for yourself that it would
not do to have it strike eleven when it is truly
twelve. And so, if my man be willing to sit
down, and our talk be very entertaining, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
clock being above him where he cannot see it
without stepping outward from the house, he
may not notice that it is stopped. This once
served me very well, for an old gentleman,
over-testy and over-punctual, once came to me
for his shoes, and looking up at the clock,
which I had prepared for him, exclaimed, ‘Bless
me! I am much too early!’ And he sat down
by me for three-quarters of an hour, in which
time I persuaded him that his shoes were far
too much worn to be worth mending any more,
and that he should have a new pair, which,
afterward, I made.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe it is right for you to do
that,” said Arla; “but even if you think so,
there is no reason why your clock should go
wrong at night, when so many people can hear
it because of the stillness.”</p>

<p>“Ah, me!” said the cobbler, “I do not object
to the clock being as right as you please in the
night; but when my day’s work is done, I am
in such a hurry to go home to my supper that
I often forget to put the clock right, or to set
it going if it is stopped. But so many things
stop at night—such as the day itself—and so
many things then go wrong—such as the ways
of evil-minded people—that I think you truly
ought to pardon my poor clock.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“Then you will not consent,” said Arla, “to
make it go right?”</p>

<p>“I will do that with all cheerfulness,” answered
the cobbler, pulling out a pair of waxed-ends
with a great jerk, “as soon as I can make
myself go right. The most important thing
should always be done first; and, surely, I am
more important than a clock!” And he smiled
with great good-humor.</p>

<p>Arla knew that it would be of no use to stand
there any longer and talk with this cobbler.
Turning to go, she said:</p>

<p>“When I bring you shoes to mend, you shall
finish them by my clock, and not by yours.”</p>

<p>“That will I, my good little Arla,” said the
cobbler, heartily. “They shall be finished by
any clock in town, and five minutes before the
hour, or no payment.”</p>

<p>Arla now walked on until she came to the
bridge over the river. It was a long, covered
bridge, and by the entrance sat the bridge-keeper.</p>

<p>“Do you know, sir,” said she, “that the clock
at this end of your bridge does not keep the
same time as the one at the other end? They
are not so very different, but I have noticed
that this one is always done striking at least
two minutes before the other begins.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>The bridge-keeper looked at her with one
eye, which was all he had.</p>

<p>“You are as wrong as anybody can be,” said
he. “I do not say anything about the striking,
because my ears are not now good enough to
hear the clock at the other end when I am near
this one; but I know they both keep the same
time. I have often looked at this clock and
have then walked to the other end of the bridge,
and have found that the clock there was exactly
like it.”</p>

<p>Arla looked at the poor old man, whose legs
were warmly swaddled on account of his rheumatism,
and said:</p>

<p>“But it must take you a good while to walk
to the other end of the bridge.”</p>

<p>“Out upon you!” cried the bridge-keeper.
“I am not so old as that yet! I can walk there
in no time!”</p>

<p>Arla now crossed the bridge and went a
short distance along a country road until she
came to the great stone house known as Vougereau.
This belonged to a rich family who
seldom came there, and the place was in charge
of an elderly man who was the brother of Arla’s
mother. When his niece was shown into a
room on the ground floor, which served for his
parlor and his office, he was very glad to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
her; and while Arla was having something to
eat and drink after her walk, the two had a
pleasant chat.</p>

<p>“I came this time, Uncle Anton,” she said,
“not only to see you, but to tell you that the
great clock in your tower does not keep good
time.”</p>

<p>Uncle Anton looked at her a little surprised.</p>

<p>“How do you know that, my dear?” he said.</p>

<p>Then Arla told him how she had lain awake
in the early morning, and had heard the striking
of the different clocks. “If you wish to
make it right,” said she, “I can give you the
proper time, for I have brought my own little
clock with me.”</p>

<p>She was about to take her rose-clock out of
her basket, when her uncle motioned to her
not to do so.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you something,” said he. “The
altering of the time of day, which you speak of
so lightly, is a very serious matter, which
should be considered with all gravity. If you
set back a clock, even as little as ten minutes,
you add that much to the time that has passed.
The hour which has just gone by has been
made seventy minutes long. Now, no human
being has the right to add anything to the past,
nor to make hours longer than they were originally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
made. And, on the other hand, if you
set a clock forward even so little as ten minutes,
you take away that much from the future,
and you make the coming hour only fifty minutes
long. Now, no human being has a right
to take anything away from the future, or to
make the hours shorter than they were intended
to be. I desire, my dear niece, that you will
earnestly think over what I have said, and I am
sure that you will then see for yourself how
unwise it would be to trifle with the length of
the hours which make up our day. And now,
Arla, let us talk of other things.”</p>

<p>And so they talked of other things until Arla
thought it was time to go. She saw there was
something wrong in her uncle’s reasoning, although
she could not tell exactly what it was,
and thinking about it, she slowly returned to
the town. As she approached the house of the
little old lady with white hair, she concluded to
stop and speak to her about her clock. “She
will surely be willing to alter that,” said Arla,
“for it is so very much out of the way.”</p>

<p>The old lady knew who Arla was, and received
her very kindly; but when she heard
why the young girl had come to her, she flew
into a passion.</p>

<p>“Never, since I was born,” she said “have I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
been spoken to like this! My great-grandfather
lived in this house before me; that clock
was good enough for him! My grandfather
lived in this house before me; that clock was
good enough for him! My father and mother
lived in this house before me; that clock was
good enough for them! I was born in this
house, have always lived in it, and expect to die
in it; that clock is good enough for me! I
heard its strokes when I was but a little child,
I hope to hear them at my last hour; and sooner
than raise my hand against the clock of my ancestors,
and the clock of my whole life, I would
cut off that hand!”</p>

<p>Some tears came into Arla’s eyes; she was a
little frightened. “I hope you will pardon me,
good madam,” she said, “for, truly, I did not
wish to offend you. Nor did I think that your
clock is not a good one. I only meant that you
should make it better; it is nearly an hour out
of the way.”</p>

<p>The sight of Arla’s tears cooled the anger of
the little old lady with white hair. “Child,”
she said, “you do not know what you are talking
about, and I forgive you. But remember
this: never ask persons as old as I am to alter
the principles which have always made clear
to them what they should do, or the clocks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
which have always told them when they should
do it.”</p>

<p>And, kissing Arla, she bade her good-by.</p>

<p>“Principles may last a great while without
altering,” thought Arla, as she went away, “but
I am sure it is very different with clocks.”</p>

<p>The poor girl now felt a good deal discouraged.</p>

<p>“The people don’t seem to care whether
their clocks are right or not,” she said to herself,
“and if they don’t care, I am sure it is of
no use for me to tell them about it. If even
one clock could be made to go properly, it
might help to make the people of Rondaine
care to know exactly what time it is. Now,
there is that iron donkey. If he would but
kick at the right hour it would be an excellent
thing, for he kicks so hard that he is heard all
over the town.”</p>

<p>Determined to make this one more effort,
Arla walked quickly to the town-building, at
the top of which was the clock with the iron
donkey. This building was a sort of museum;
it had a great many curious things in it, and it
was in charge of a very ingenious man, who
was learned and skilful in various ways.</p>

<p>When Arla had informed the superintendent
of the museum why she had come to him, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
did not laugh at her nor did he get angry.
He was accustomed to giving earnest consideration
to matters of this sort, and he listened
attentively to all that Arla had to say.</p>

<p>“You must know,” he said, “that our iron
donkey is a very complicated piece of mechanism.
Not only must he kick out the hours, but
five minutes before doing so he must turn his
head around and look at the bell behind him;
and then, when he has done kicking, he must
put his head back into its former position. All
this action requires a great many wheels and
cogs and springs and levers, and these cannot
be made to move with absolute regularity.
When it is cold, some of his works contract;
and when it is warm, they expand; and there
are other reasons why he is very likely to lose
or gain time. At noon, on every bright day, I
set him right, being able to get the correct time
from a sun-dial which stands in the court-yard.
But his works—which I am sorry to say are
not well made—are sure to get a great deal
out of the way before I set him again.”</p>

<p>“Then, if there are several cloudy or rainy
days together, he goes very wrong indeed,”
said Arla.</p>

<p>“Yes, he truly does,” replied the superintendent,
“and I am sorry for it. But there is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
way to help it except for me to make him all
over again at my own expense, and that is
something I cannot afford to do. The clock
belongs to the town, and I am sure the citizens
will not be willing to spend the money necessary
for a new donkey-clock; for, so far as I
know, every person but yourself is perfectly
satisfied with this one.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” said Arla, with a sigh;
“but it really is a great pity that every striking-clock
in Rondaine should be wrong!”</p>

<p>“But how do you know they are all wrong?”
asked the superintendent.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is easy enough,” said Arla. “When
I lie awake in the early morning, when all else
is very still, I listen to their striking, and then
I look at my own rose-clock to see what time
it really is.”</p>

<p>“Your rose-clock?” said the superintendent.</p>

<p>“This is it,” said Arla, opening her basket
and taking out her little clock.</p>

<p>The superintendent took it into his hands
and looked at it attentively, both outside and
inside. And then, still holding it, he stepped
out into the court-yard. When in a few
moments he returned, he said:</p>

<p>“I have compared your clock with my sun-dial,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
and find that it is ten minutes slow. I also
see that, like the donkey-clock, its works are
not adjusted in such a way as to be unaffected
by heat and cold.”</p>

<p>“My—clock—ten—minutes—slow!” exclaimed
Arla, with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the superintendent, “that is the
case to-day, and on some days it is, probably,
a great deal too fast. Such a clock as this—which
is a very ingenious and beautiful one—ought
frequently to be compared with a sun-dial
or other correct time-keeper, and set to
the proper hour. I see it requires a peculiar
key with which to set it. Have you brought
this with you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Arla; “I did not suppose it
would be needed.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said the superintendent, “you
can set it forward ten minutes when you reach
home; and if to-morrow morning you compare
the other clocks with it, I think you will
find that not all of them are wrong.”</p>

<p>Arla sat quiet for a moment, and then she
said: “I think I shall not care any more to
compare the clocks of Rondaine with my little
rose-clock. If the people are satisfied with
their own clocks, whether they are fast or slow,
and do not care to know exactly when Christmas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
Day begins, I can do nobody any good by
listening to the different strikings and then
looking at my own little clock, with a night-lamp
by it.”</p>

<p>“Especially,” said the superintendent, with a
smile, “when you are not sure that your rose-clock
is right. But if you bring here your
little clock and your key on any day when the
sun is shining, I will set it to the time shadowed
on the sun-dial, or show you how to do it yourself.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much,” said Arla, and she
took her leave.</p>

<p>As she walked home, she lifted the lid of her
basket and looked at her little rose-clock. “To
think of it!” she said. “That you should be
sometimes too fast and sometimes too slow!
And, worse than that, to think that some of
the other clocks have been right and you have
been wrong! But I do not feel like altering
you to-day. If you go fast sometimes, and
slow sometimes, you must be right sometimes,
and one of these days, when I take you to be
compared with the sun-dial, perhaps you will
not have to be altered so much.”</p>

<p>Arla went to bed that night quite tired with
her long walks, and when she awoke it was
broad daylight. “I do not know,” she said to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
herself, “exactly when Christmas began, but I
am very sure that the happy day is here.”</p>

<p>“Do you lie awake in the morning as much
as you used to?” asked Arla’s mother, a few
weeks after the Christmas holidays.</p>

<p>“No, mother dear,” said Arla; “I now sleep
with one of my windows shut, and I am no
longer awakened by that chilly feeling which
used to come to me in the early morning, when
I would draw the bed-covers close about me
and think how wrong were the clocks of
Rondaine.”</p>

<p>And the little rose-clock never went to be
compared with the sun-dial. “Perhaps you
are right now,” Arla would say to her clock
each day when the sun shone, “and I will not
take you until some time when I feel very sure
that you are wrong.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE GRIFFIN AND THE MINOR
CANON</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Over</span> the great door of an old, old church
which stood in a quiet town of a far-away land
there was carved in stone the figure of a large
griffin. The old-time sculptor had done his
work with great care, but the image he had
made was not a pleasant one to look at. It had
a large head, with enormous open mouth and
savage teeth; from its back arose great wings,
armed with sharp hooks and prongs; it had
stout legs in front, with projecting claws; but
there were no legs behind,—the body running
out into a long and powerful tail, finished off at
the end with a barbed point. This tail was
coiled up under him, the end sticking up just
back of his wings.</p>

<p>The sculptor, or the people who had ordered
this stone figure, had evidently been very much
pleased with it, for little copies of it, also in
stone, had been placed here and there along
the sides of the church, not very far from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
ground, so that people could easily look at them,
and ponder on their curious forms. There
were a great many other sculptures on the outside
of this church—saints, martyrs, grotesque
heads of men, beasts, and birds, as well as those
of other creatures which cannot be named, because
nobody knows exactly what they were;
but none were so curious and interesting as the
great griffin over the door, and the little griffins
on the sides of the church.</p>

<p>A long, long distance from the town, in the
midst of dreadful wilds scarcely known to man,
there dwelt the Griffin whose image had been
put up over the church-door. In some way or
other, the old-time sculptor had seen him and
afterward, to the best of his memory, had copied
his figure in stone.</p>

<p>The Griffin had never known this, until,
hundreds of years afterward, he heard from a
bird, from a wild animal, or in some manner
which it is not now easy to find out, that there
was a likeness of him on the old church in the
distant town.</p>

<p>Now, this Griffin had no idea how he looked.
He had never seen a mirror, and the streams
where he lived were so turbulent and violent
that a quiet piece of water, which would reflect
the image of any thing looking into it, could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
not be found. Being, as far as could be known,
the very last of his race, he had never seen another
griffin. Therefore it was that, when he
heard of this stone image of himself, he became
very anxious to know what he looked like, and
at last he determined to go to the old church,
and see for himself what manner of being he
was.</p>

<p>So he started off from the dreadful wilds,
and flew on and on until he came to the countries
inhabited by men, where his appearance in the
air created great consternation; but he alighted
nowhere, keeping up a steady flight until he
reached the suburbs of the town which had his
image on its church. Here, late in the afternoon,
he alighted in a green meadow by the
side of a brook, and stretched himself on the
grass to rest. His great wings were tired, for
he had not made such a long flight in a century,
or more.</p>

<p>The news of his coming spread quickly over
the town, and the people, frightened nearly out
of their wits by the arrival of so strange a
visitor, fled into their houses, and shut themselves
up. The Griffin called loudly for some
one to come to him; but the more he called, the
more afraid the people were to show themselves.
At length he saw two laborers hurrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
to their homes through the fields, and in
a terrible voice he commanded them to stop.
Not daring to disobey, the men stood, trembling.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you all?” cried
the Griffin. “Is there not a man in your town
who is brave enough to speak to me?”</p>

<p>“I think,” said one of the laborers, his voice
shaking so that his words could hardly be
understood, “that—perhaps—the Minor Canon—would
come.”</p>

<p>“Go, call him, then!” said the Griffin; “I
want to see him.”</p>

<p>The Minor Canon, who was an assistant in
the old church, had just finished the afternoon
services, and was coming out of a side door,
with three aged women who had formed the
week-day congregation. He was a young man
of a kind disposition, and very anxious to do
good to the people of the town. Apart from
his duties in the church, where he conducted
services every week-day, he visited the sick
and the poor, counselled and assisted persons
who were in trouble, and taught a school composed
entirely of the bad children in the town
with whom nobody else would have anything
to do. Whenever the people wanted something
difficult done for them, they always went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
to the Minor Canon. Thus it was that the
laborer thought of the young priest when he
found that someone must come and speak to
the Griffin.</p>

<p>The Minor Canon had not heard of the
strange event, which was known to the whole
town except himself and the three old women,
and when he was informed of it, and was told
that the Griffin had asked to see him, he was
greatly amazed and frightened.</p>

<p>“Me!” he exclaimed. “He has never heard
of me! What should he want with <i>me</i>?”</p>

<p>“Oh! you must go instantly!” cried the two
men. “He is very angry now because he has
been kept waiting so long; and nobody knows
what may happen if you don’t hurry to him.”</p>

<p>The poor Minor Canon would rather have
had his hand cut off than go out to meet an
angry Griffin; but he felt that it was his duty
to go, for it would be a woful thing if injury
should come to the people of the town because
he was not brave enough to obey the summons
of the Griffin. So, pale and frightened, he
started off.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Griffin, as soon as the young
man came near, “I am glad to see that there is
someone who has the courage to come to
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>The Minor Canon did not feel very brave,
but he bowed his head.</p>

<p>“Is this the town,” said the Griffin, “where
there is a church with a likeness of myself over
one of the doors?”</p>

<p>The Minor Canon looked at the frightful creature
before him and saw that it was, without
doubt, exactly like the stone image on the
church. “Yes,” he said, “you are right.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said the Griffin, “will you take
me to it? I wish very much to see it.”</p>

<p>The Minor Canon instantly thought that if
the Griffin entered the town without the people’s
knowing what he came for, some of them
would probably be frightened to death, and so
he sought to gain time to prepare their minds.</p>

<p>“It is growing dark, now,” he said, very
much afraid, as he spoke, that his words might
enrage the Griffin, “and objects on the front of
the church cannot be seen clearly. It will be
better to wait until morning, if you wish to get
a good view of the stone image of yourself.”</p>

<p>“That will suit me very well,” said the Griffin.
“I see you are a man of good sense. I am
tired, and I will take a nap here on this soft
grass, while I cool my tail in the little stream
that runs near me. The end of my tail gets
red-hot when I am angry or excited, and it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
quite warm now. So you may go; but be sure
and come early to-morrow morning, and show
me the way to the church.”</p>

<p>The Minor Canon was glad enough to take
his leave, and hurried into the town. In front
of the church he found a great many people
assembled to hear his report of his talk with
the Griffin. When they found that he had not
come to spread ruin, but simply to see his stony
likeness on the church, they showed neither
relief nor gratification, but began to upbraid the
Minor Canon for consenting to conduct the
creature into the town.</p>

<p>“What could I do?” cried the young man.
“If I should not bring him he would come himself
and, perhaps, end by setting fire to the town
with his red-hot tail.”</p>

<p>Still the people were not satisfied, and a great
many plans were proposed to prevent the Griffin
from coming into the town. Some elderly
persons urged that the young men should go
out and kill him; but the young men scoffed
at such a ridiculous idea.</p>

<p>Then someone said that it would be a good
thing to destroy the stone image so that the
Griffin would have no excuse for entering the
town; and this plan was received with such
favor that many of the people ran for hammers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
chisels, and crowbars, with which to tear down
and break up the stone griffin. But the Minor
Canon resisted this plan with all the strength
of his mind and body. He assured the people
that this action would enrage the Griffin beyond
measure, for it would be impossible to conceal
from him that his image had been destroyed
during the night. But the people were so determined
to break up the stone griffin that the
Minor Canon saw that there was nothing for
him to do but to stay there and protect it. All
night he walked up and down in front of the
church-door, keeping away the men who
brought ladders, by which they might mount
to the great stone griffin, and knock it to pieces
with their hammers and crowbars. After many
hours the people were obliged to give up their
attempts, and went home to sleep; but the
Minor Canon remained at his post till early
morning, and then he hurried away to the field
where he had left the Griffin.</p>

<p>The monster had just awakened, and rising
to his forelegs and shaking himself he said
that he was ready to go into the town. The
Minor Canon, therefore, walked back, the
Griffin flying slowly through the air, at a short
distance above the head of his guide. Not a
person was to be seen in the streets, and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
went directly to the front of the church, where
the Minor Canon pointed out the stone griffin.</p>

<p>The real Griffin settled down in the little
square before the church and gazed earnestly
at his sculptured likeness. For a long time
he looked at it. First he put his head on
one side, and then he put it on the other; then
he shut his right eye and gazed with his left,
after which he shut his left eye and gazed with
his right. Then he moved a little to one side
and looked at the image, then he moved the
other way. After a while he said to the Minor
Canon, who had been standing by all this
time:</p>

<p>“It is, it must be, an excellent likeness! That
breadth between the eyes, that expansive forehead,
those massive jaws! I feel that it must
resemble me. If there is any fault to find with
it, it is that the neck seems a little stiff. But
that is nothing. It is an admirable likeness—admirable!”</p>

<p>The Griffin sat looking at his image all the
morning and all the afternoon. The Minor Canon
had been afraid to go away and leave him, and
had hoped all through the day that he would
soon be satisfied with his inspection and fly
away home. But by evening the poor young
man was very tired, and felt that he must eat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
and sleep. He frankly said this to the Griffin,
and asked him if he would not like something
to eat. He said this because he felt obliged
in politeness to do so; but as soon as he had
spoken the words, he was seized with dread
lest the monster should demand half a dozen
babies, or some tempting repast of that kind.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said the Griffin; “I never eat
between the equinoxes. At the vernal and at
the autumnal equinox I take a good meal, and
that lasts me for half a year. I am extremely
regular in my habits, and do not think it
healthful to eat at odd times. But if you need
food, go and get it, and I will return to the
soft grass where I slept last night and take
another nap.”</p>

<p>The next day the Griffin came again to the
little square before the church, and remained
there until evening, steadfastly regarding the
stone griffin over the door. The Minor Canon
came once or twice to look at him, and the Griffin
seemed very glad to see him; but the young
clergyman could not stay as he had done before,
for he had many duties to perform. Nobody
went to the church, but the people came to
the Minor Canon’s house, and anxiously asked
him how long the Griffin was going to stay.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” he answered, “but I think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
he will soon be satisfied with regarding his
stone likeness, and then he will go away.”</p>

<p>But the Griffin did not go away. Morning
after morning he came to the church; but after
a time he did not stay there all day. He seemed
to have taken a great fancy to the Minor Canon,
and followed him about as he worked. He
would wait for him at the side door of the
church, for the Minor Canon held services
every day, morning and evening, though nobody
came now. “If anyone should come,”
he said to himself, “I must be found at my
post.” When the young man came out, the
Griffin would accompany him in his visits to
the sick and the poor, and would often look
into the windows of the school-house where
the Minor Canon was teaching his unruly
scholars. All the other schools were closed,
but the parents of the Minor Canon’s scholars
forced them to go to school, because they were
so bad they could not endure them all day at
home—Griffin or no Griffin. But it must be
said they generally behaved very well when
that great monster sat up on his tail and looked
in at the school-room window.</p>

<p>When it was found that the Griffin showed
no sign of going away, all the people who were
able to do so left the town. The canons and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
the higher officers of the church had fled away
during the first day of the Griffin’s visit, leaving
behind only the Minor Canon and some of
the men who opened the doors and swept the
church. All the citizens who could afford it
shut up their houses and travelled to distant
parts, and only the working-people and the
poor were left behind. After some days these
ventured to go about and attend to their business,
for if they did not work they would
starve. They were getting a little used to seeing
the Griffin; and having been told that he
did not eat between equinoxes, they did not
feel so much afraid of him as before.</p>

<p>Day by day the Griffin became more and
more attached to the Minor Canon. He kept
near him a great part of the time, and often
spent the night in front of the little house
where the young clergyman lived alone. This
strange companionship was often burdensome
to the Minor Canon; but, on the other hand,
he could not deny that he derived a great deal
of benefit and instruction from it. The Griffin
had lived for hundreds of years, and had seen
much, and he told the Minor Canon many
wonderful things.</p>

<p>“It is like reading an old book,” said the
young clergyman to himself; “but how many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
books I would have had to read before I would
have found out what the Griffin has told me
about the earth, the air, the water, about minerals,
and metals, and growing things, and all
the wonders of the world!”</p>

<p>Thus the summer went on, and drew toward
its close. And now the people of the town
began to be very much troubled again.</p>

<p>“It will not be long,” they said, “before the
autumnal equinox is here, and then that monster
will want to eat. He will be dreadfully
hungry, for he has taken so much exercise
since his last meal. He will devour our children.
Without doubt, he will eat them all.
What is to be done?”</p>

<p>To this question no one could give an answer,
but all agreed that the Griffin must not be
allowed to remain until the approaching equinox.
After talking over the matter a great deal,
a crowd of the people went to the Minor Canon
at a time when the Griffin was not with him.</p>

<p>“It is all your fault,” they said, “that that
monster is among us. You brought him here,
and you ought to see that he goes away. It is
only on your account that he stays here at all;
for, although he visits his image every day, he
is with you the greater part of the time. If
you were not here, he would not stay. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
your duty to go away, and then he will follow
you, and we shall be free from the dreadful
danger which hangs over us.”</p>

<p>“Go away!” cried the Minor Canon, greatly
grieved at being spoken to in such a way.
“Where shall I go? If I go to some other
town, shall I not take this trouble there?
Have I a right to do that?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the people, “you must not go to
any other town. There is no town far enough
away. You must go to the dreadful wilds
where the Griffin lives; and then he will follow
you and stay there.”</p>

<p>They did not say whether or not they expected
the Minor Canon to stay there also, and
he did not ask them anything about it. He
bowed his head, and went into his house to
think. The more he thought, the more clear
it became to his mind that it was his duty to
go away, and thus free the town from the presence
of the Griffin.</p>

<p>That evening he packed a leathern bag full
of bread and meat, and early the next morning
he set out on his journey to the dreadful wilds.
It was a long, weary, and doleful journey, especially
after he had gone beyond the habitations
of men; but the Minor Canon kept on bravely,
and never faltered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>The way was longer than he had expected,
and his provisions soon grew so scanty that he
was obliged to eat but a little every day; but
he kept up his courage, and pressed on, and,
after many days of toilsome travel, he reached
the dreadful wilds.</p>

<p>When the Griffin found that the Minor
Canon had left the town he seemed sorry, but
showed no desire to go and look for him.
After a few days had passed he became much
annoyed, and asked some of the people where
the Minor Canon had gone. But, although
the citizens had been so anxious that the
young clergyman should go to the dreadful
wilds, thinking that the Griffin would immediately
follow him, they were now afraid to mention
the Minor Canon’s destination, for the
monster seemed angry already, and if he
should suspect their trick he would, doubtless,
become very much enraged. So everyone said
he did not know, and the Griffin wandered
about disconsolate. One morning he looked
into the Minor Canon’s school-house, which
was always empty now, and thought that it
was a shame that everything should suffer on
account of the young man’s absence.</p>

<p>“It does not matter so much about the
church,” he said, “for nobody went there; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
it is a pity about the school. I think I will
teach it myself until he returns.”</p>

<p>It was the hour for opening the school,
and the Griffin went inside and pulled the
rope which rang the school-bell. Some of the
children who heard the bell ran in to see what
was the matter, supposing it to be a joke of
one of their companions; but when they saw
the Griffin they stood astonished and scared.</p>

<p>“Go tell the other scholars,” said the monster,
“that school is about to open, and that if they
are not all here in ten minutes I shall come
after them.”</p>

<p>In seven minutes every scholar was in place.</p>

<p>Never was seen such an orderly school. Not
a boy or girl moved or uttered a whisper.
The Griffin climbed into the master’s seat, his
wide wings spread on each side of him, because
he could not lean back in his chair while they
stuck out behind, and his great tail coiled
around, in front of the desk, the barbed end
sticking up, ready to tap any boy or girl who
might misbehave.</p>

<p>The Griffin now addressed the scholars, telling
them that he intended to teach them while
their master was away. In speaking he tried
to imitate, as far as possible, the mild and
gentle tones of the Minor Canon; but it must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
be admitted that in this he was not very successful.
He had paid a good deal of attention to
the studies of the school, and he determined
not to try to teach them anything new, but to
review them in what they had been studying;
so he called up the various classes, and questioned
them upon their previous lessons. The
children racked their brains to remember what
they had learned. They were so afraid of the
Griffin’s displeasure that they recited as they
had never recited before. One of the boys, far
down in his class, answered so well that the
Griffin was astonished.</p>

<p>“I should think you would be at the head,”
said he. “I am sure you have never been in
the habit of reciting so well. Why is this?”</p>

<p>“Because I did not choose to take the
trouble,” said the boy, trembling in his boots.
He felt obliged to speak the truth, for all the
children thought that the great eyes of the
Griffin could see right through them, and that
he would know when they told a falsehood.</p>

<p>“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said
the Griffin. “Go down to the very tail of the
class; and if you are not at the head in two
days, I shall know the reason why.”</p>

<p>The next afternoon this boy was Number One.</p>

<p>It was astonishing how much these children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
now learned of what they had been studying.
It was as if they had been educated over again.
The Griffin used no severity toward them, but
there was a look about him which made them
unwilling to go to bed until they were sure
they knew their lessons for the next day.</p>

<p>The Griffin now thought that he ought to
visit the sick and the poor; and he began to go
about the town for this purpose. The effect
upon the sick was miraculous. All, except
those who were very ill indeed, jumped from
their beds when they heard he was coming, and
declared themselves quite well. To those who
could not get up he gave herbs and roots,
which none of them had ever before thought of
as medicines, but which the Griffin had seen
used in various parts of the world; and most
of them recovered. But, for all that, they
afterward said that, no matter what happened
to them, they hoped that they should never
again have such a doctor coming to their bedsides,
feeling their pulses and looking at their
tongues.</p>

<p>As for the poor, they seemed to have utterly
disappeared. All those who had depended
upon charity for their daily bread were now at
work in some way or other; many of them offering
to do odd jobs for their neighbors just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
for the sake of their meals—a thing which before
had been seldom heard of in the town.
The Griffin could find no one who needed his
assistance.</p>

<p>The summer had now passed, and the autumnal
equinox was rapidly approaching. The
citizens were in a state of great alarm and
anxiety. The Griffin showed no signs of going
away, but seemed to have settled himself permanently
among them. In a short time the
day for his semi-annual meal would arrive, and
then what would happen? The monster would
certainly be very hungry, and would devour
all their children.</p>

<p>Now they greatly regretted and lamented
that they had sent away the Minor Canon; he
was the only one on whom they could have
depended in this trouble, for he could talk
freely with the Griffin, and so find out what
could be done. But it would not do to be inactive.
Some step must be taken immediately.
A meeting of the citizens was called, and two
old men were appointed to go and talk to the
Griffin. They were instructed to offer to prepare
a splendid dinner for him on equinox
day—one which would entirely satisfy his hunger.
They would offer him the fattest mutton,
the most tender beef, fish, and game of various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
sorts, and anything of the kind that he might
fancy. If none of these suited, they were to
mention that there was an orphan asylum in
the next town.</p>

<p>“Anything would be better,” said the citizens,
“than to have our dear children devoured.”</p>

<p>The old men went to the Griffin; but their
propositions were not received with favor.</p>

<p>“From what I have seen of the people of
this town,” said the monster, “I do not think I
could relish anything which was prepared by
them. They appear to be all cowards, and,
therefore, mean and selfish. As for eating one
of them, old or young, I could not think of it
for a moment. In fact, there was only one
creature in the whole place for whom I could
have had any appetite, and that is the Minor
Canon, who has gone away. He was brave,
and good, and honest, and I think I should
have relished him.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said one of the old men very politely,
“in that case I wish we had not sent him
to the dreadful wilds!”</p>

<p>“What!” cried the Griffin. “What do you
mean? Explain instantly what you are talking
about!”</p>

<p>The old man, terribly frightened at what he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
had said, was obliged to tell how the Minor
Canon had been sent away by the people, in
the hope that the Griffin might be induced to
follow him.</p>

<p>When the monster heard this he became
furiously angry. He dashed away from the old
men, and, spreading his wings, flew backward
and forward over the town. He was so much
excited that his tail became red-hot, and glowed
like a meteor against the evening sky. When
at last he settled down in the little field where
he usually rested, and thrust his tail into the
brook, the steam arose like a cloud, and the
water of the stream ran hot through the town.
The citizens were greatly frightened, and bitterly
blamed the old man for telling about the
Minor Canon.</p>

<p>“It is plain,” they said, “that the Griffin intended
at last to go and look for him, and we
should have been saved. Now who can tell
what misery you have brought upon us.”</p>

<p>The Griffin did not remain long in the little
field. As soon as his tail was cool he flew to
the town-hall and rang the bell. The citizens
knew that they were expected to come there;
and although they were afraid to go, they were
still more afraid to stay away; and they crowded
into the hall. The Griffin was on the platform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
at one end, flapping his wings and walking
up and down, and the end of his tail was
still so warm that it slightly scorched the
boards as he dragged it after him.</p>

<p>When everybody who was able to come was
there, the Griffin stood still and addressed the
meeting.</p>

<p>“I have had a very low opinion of you,” he
said, “ever since I discovered what cowards
you are, but I had no idea that you were so
ungrateful, selfish, and cruel as I now find
you to be. Here was your Minor Canon, who
labored day and night for your good, and
thought of nothing else but how he might benefit
you and make you happy; and as soon as
you imagine yourselves threatened with a danger—for
well I know you are dreadfully afraid
of me—you send him off, caring not whether he
returns or perishes, hoping thereby to save
yourselves. Now, I had conceived a great liking
for that young man, and had intended, in a
day or two, to go and look him up. But I have
changed my mind about him. I shall go and
find him, but I shall send him back here to live
among you, and I intend that he shall enjoy
the reward of his labor and his sacrifices.</p>

<p>“Go, some of you, to the officers of the
church, who so cowardly ran away when I first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
came here, and tell them never to return to this
town under penalty of death. And if, when
your Minor Canon comes back to you, you do
not bow yourselves before him, put him in the
highest place among you, and serve and honor
him all his life, beware of my terrible vengeance!
There were only two good things in
this town: the Minor Canon and the stone image
of myself over your church-door. One of
these you have sent away, and the other I shall
carry away myself.”</p>

<p>With these words he dismissed the meeting,
and it was time, for the end of his tail had become
so hot that there was danger of its setting
fire to the building.</p>

<p>The next morning the Griffin came to the
church, and tearing the stone image of himself
from its fastenings over the great door, he
grasped it with his powerful forelegs and flew
up into the air. Then, after hovering over the
town for a moment, he gave his tail an angry
shake and took up his flight to the dreadful
wilds. When he reached this desolate region,
he set the stone griffin upon a ledge of a rock
which rose in front of the dismal cave he called
his home. There the image occupied a position
somewhat similar to that it had had over the
church-door; and the Griffin, panting with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
exertion of carrying such an enormous load to
so great a distance, lay down upon the ground
and regarded it with much satisfaction. When
he felt somewhat rested he went to look for the
Minor Canon. He found the young man, weak
and half-starved, lying under the shadow of a
rock. After picking him up and carrying him
to his cave, the Griffin flew away to a distant
marsh, where he procured some roots and herbs
which he well knew were strengthening and
beneficial to man, though he had never tasted
them himself. After eating these the Minor
Canon was greatly revived, and sat up and
listened while the Griffin told him what had
happened in the town.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” said the monster, when he
had finished, “that I have had, and still have, a
great liking for you?”</p>

<p>“I am very glad to hear it,” said the Minor
Canon, with his usual politeness.</p>

<p>“I am not at all sure that you would be,”
said the Griffin, “if you thoroughly understood
the state of the case; but we will not consider
that now. If some things were different, other
things would be otherwise. I have been so enraged
by discovering the manner in which you
have been treated that I have determined that
you shall at last enjoy the rewards and honors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
to which you are entitled. Lie down and have
a good sleep, and then I will take you back to
the town.”</p>

<p>As he heard these words, a look of trouble
came over the young man’s face.</p>

<p>“You need not give yourself any anxiety,”
said the Griffin, “about my return to the town.
I shall not remain there. Now that I have that
admirable likeness of myself in front of my
cave, where I can sit at my leisure, and gaze
upon its noble features, I have no wish to see
that abode of cowardly and selfish people.”</p>

<p>The Minor Canon, relieved from his fears,
lay back, and dropped into a doze; and when
he was sound asleep the Griffin took him up,
and carried him back to the town. He arrived
just before daybreak, and, putting the young
man gently on the grass in the little field where
he himself used to rest, the monster, without
having been seen by any of the people, flew
back to his home.</p>

<p>When the Minor Canon made his appearance
in the morning among the citizens, the enthusiasm
and cordiality with which he was received
were truly wonderful. He was taken to a
house which had been occupied by one of the
banished high officers of the place, and everyone
was anxious to do all that could be done for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
his health and comfort. The people crowded
into the church when he held services, so that
the three old women who used to be his week-day
congregation could not get to the best
seats, which they had always been in the habit
of taking; and the parents of the bad children
determined to reform them at home, in order
that he might be spared the trouble of keeping
up his former school. The Minor Canon was
appointed to the highest office of the old church,
and before he died he became a bishop.</p>

<p>During the first years after his return from
the dreadful wilds the people of the town
looked up to him as a man to whom they were
bound to do honor and reverence; but they
often, also, looked up to the sky to see if there
were any signs of the Griffin coming back.
However, in the course of time, they learned to
honor and reverence their former Minor Canon
without the fear of being punished if they did
not do so.</p>

<p>But they need never have been afraid of
the Griffin. The autumnal equinox day came
round, and the monster ate nothing. If he
could not have the Minor Canon, he did not
care for anything. So, lying down, with his
eyes fixed upon the great stone griffin, he gradually
declined, and died. It was a good thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
for some of the people of the town that they
did not know this.</p>

<p>If you should ever visit the old town, you
would still see the little griffins on the sides of
the church; but the great stone griffin that was
over the door is gone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE CHRISTMAS TRUANTS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Christmas</span> was coming, a long time ago, and
the boys in a certain far-away school were talking
and thinking about it. Eleven of these
youngsters, who were all great friends, and
generally kept together, whether at work or
play, held a secret meeting, at which they resolved
that they were tired of the ordinary ways
of spending Christmas.</p>

<p>“We are bored to death,” said one of the
older boys, “with Christmas trees, with Christmas
games, with Christmas carols, and with
the hanging-up of stockings on Christmas Eve.
Such things may do very well for children, but
we have grown out of them.”</p>

<p>“That’s true!” cried the others. “We’ve
grown out of that kind of nonsense.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!” exclaimed the smallest boy of all,
who was generally known as Tomtit. “We’ve
grown out of that.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_108fp">

<p class="caption">THEY WERE MARCHED AWAY TO THE ROBBER’S CASTLE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“Of course,” said the biggest boy, who was
called by his companions Old Pluck, because
he had never been found to be afraid of anything,
“there will be this Christmas childishness
at the school, just as there has been always;
and I propose that, instead of staying
here and submitting to it, we run away, and
have a Christmas to suit ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried the other boys. “That’s
what we shall do. Have a Christmas to suit
ourselves.”</p>

<p>Having made up their minds to this, these
eleven boys, on the afternoon of the next day
but one to Christmas, ran away from school,
in order that they might find a place where
they would be free to celebrate the great holiday
in whatever way they pleased. They
walked as fast as they could, little Tomtit keeping
up bravely in the rear, although he was
obliged to run almost as much as he walked,
until they were at a long distance from the
school. Night was now coming on, and Old
Pluck called a halt.</p>

<p>“Boys,” said he, “we will camp at the edge
of that forest, and those of you who have
brought bows and arrows had better look about
and see if you can’t shoot some birds and rabbits
for our supper. The unarmed members must
gather wood to make a camp-fire. But if you
are tired, Tomtit, you needn’t do anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“Tired!” exclaimed the little fellow, standing
up very straight and throwing out his
chest; “I should like to know why I should
be tired. I’ll go and bring some logs.”</p>

<p>Tomtit was very anxious to be considered
just as strong and active as the other boys.
Every morning he used to get one of his companions
to feel the muscles of his arms, to see
if they had not increased in size since the day
before.</p>

<p>The camp-fire was burning brightly when
the boys with the bows and arrows returned,
stating that they had found it rather too late
in the day for game, and that it would be better
to postpone the shooting of birds and rabbits
till the next morning. Old Pluck then asked
the members of his little company what provisions
they had brought with them; and it was
found that no one except Tomtit had thought
of bringing anything. He had in his coat-pocket
a luncheon of bread and meat. It was
thereupon ordered that Tomtit’s luncheon
should be divided into eleven portions, and
the little fellow was given a knife with which
to cut it up.</p>

<p>It was at this time that there came through
the forest a band of robbers—five men and a
chief. These men, on their way to their castle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
had been talking about the approach of Christmas.</p>

<p>“I am getting very tired,” said the chief,
“of the wild revelries with which on great
occasions we make our castle ring. It would
be a most agreeable relief, methinks, if we
could celebrate the coming Christmas as ordinary
people do. The trouble is we don’t know
how.”</p>

<p>“You speak well,” replied one of his followers.
“We would be glad enough to have the
ordinary Christmas festivities if we did but
know how such things are managed.”</p>

<p>The conversation was cut short at this point
by the discovery of a camp-fire at the edge of
the wood. Instantly every robber crouched
close to the ground, and crept silently to the
spot where the boys were gathered around
Tomtit, watching him as he cut up his
luncheon.</p>

<p>In a few moments the chief gave a whistle,
and then the robbers rushed out, and each of
the men seized two of the larger boys, while
the chief stooped down and grasped Tomtit
by the collar. Some of the boys kicked and
scuffled a great deal; but this was of no use,
and they were all marched away to the robbers’
castle, little Tomtit feeling very proud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
that it took a whole man to hold him by the
collar.</p>

<p>When they reached the castle the boys were
shut up in a large room, where they were soon
provided with a plentiful supper. Having finished
their meal, they were conducted to the
great hall of the castle, where the robber chief
sat in his chair of state, a huge fire blazing upon
the hearth, while suits of armor, glittering
weapons, and trophies of many kinds were hung
upon the walls.</p>

<p>The boys were now ordered to tell their
story; and when Old Pluck had finished it, the
chief addressed his captives thus: “I am sure
that you young fellows could never have
imagined the pleasure you were going to give
to me when you determined to run away from
school at this happy season.</p>

<p>“My men and myself have a fancy for a
Christmas like that of other people. We want a
Christmas tree, Christmas carols and games,
and all that sort of festivity. We know nothing
about these things ourselves, and were wondering
how we could manage to have the kind of
Christmas we want. But now that we have you
boys with us, it will all be simple and easy
enough. You shall celebrate Christmas for us
in the manner to which you have always been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
accustomed. We will provide you with
everything that is necessary, and we will have
a good old school-and-home Christmas. You
shall even hang up your stockings, and I will
see to it that Santa Claus for the first time visits
this castle. And now, my fine fellows, to bed
with you, and to-morrow we will all go to work
to prepare for a good old-fashioned Christmas.”</p>

<p>The boys were conducted to a large upper
room, where they found eleven mattresses
spread out upon the floor. They threw themselves
upon their beds; but not one of them
could close his eyes through thinking of the
doleful plight which they were in. They had
run away to get rid of the tiresome old Christmas
doings, and now they were to go through
all those very things just to please a band of
robbers. The thought of it was insupportable,
and for an hour or two each boy rolled and
moaned upon his mattress.</p>

<p>At last Old Pluck spoke. “Boys,” he said,
“all is now quiet below, and I believe those
rascally robbers have gone to bed. Let us
wait a little while longer, and then slip downstairs
and run away. We can surely find some
door or window which we can open; and I, for
one, am not willing to stay here and act the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
part of a Christmas slave for the pleasure of
these bandits.”</p>

<p>“No,” exclaimed Tomtit, sitting up in bed,
so as to expand his chest, “we will never consent
to that.”</p>

<p>The boys eagerly agreed to Old Pluck’s
plan, and in about half an hour they quietly
arose and stole toward the stairs. The full
moon was shining in through the windows, so
that they could see perfectly well where they
were going. They had gone a short distance
down the great staircase, when Old Pluck,
who led the way, heard a slight noise behind
him. Turning to inquire what this was, he
was told it was the cracking of Tomtit’s knees.</p>

<p>“Pass the word to Tomtit,” he said, in a
whisper, “that if he can’t keep his knees from
cracking he must stay where he is.”</p>

<p>Poor little Tomtit, who brought up the rear,
was dreadfully troubled when he heard this;
but he bravely passed the word back that his
knees should not crack any more, and the line
moved on.</p>

<p>It was difficult now for Tomtit to take a
step, for if he bent his knees they were sure to
crack. He tried going downstairs stiff-legged,
like a pair of scissors; but this he found almost
impossible, so he made up his mind that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
only thing he could do was to slide down the
broad banister. He was used to this feat, and
he performed it with much dexterity. The
banister, however, was very smooth and steep,
and he went down much faster than he intended,
shooting off at the bottom, and landing
on the floor on the broad of his back.</p>

<p>The boys were now in the great hall, and,
seeing a light in the adjoining room, they
looked into it. There, upon couches made of
the skins of wild beasts, they saw the six robbers,
fast asleep. A happy thought now came
into the mind of Old Pluck. Stepping back,
he looked around him, and soon perceived in
one corner of the hall a quantity of rich stuffs
and other booty, bound up into bundles with
heavy cords. Taking out his knife he quickly
cut off a number of these cords and gave them
to his companions.</p>

<p>“Boys,” he then whispered, “I have thought
of a splendid plan. Let us bind these robbers
hand and foot, and then, instead of doing what
they want us to do, we can make them do what
we want. That will be ever so much better
fun than running away.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said the boys. “But suppose they
wake up while we are tying them?”</p>

<p>“If we are truly brave,” said Old Pluck, “we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
must just go ahead, and not think of anything
like that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Tomtit, straightening himself
and throwing out his chest, “we mustn’t
think of anything of that sort.”</p>

<p>The little fellow was terribly frightened at
the idea of going into that room and tying
those big, savage men; but if the other fellows
did it, he was bound to do it too.</p>

<p>The boys now softly slipped into the room,
and as the robbers slept very soundly, it was
not long before they were all securely bound
hand and foot, Old Pluck going around himself
to see that every cord was well drawn
and knotted. Then, motioning to the boys to
follow him, he went into the great hall, and
there he ordered his companions to arm themselves.</p>

<p>This command was obeyed with delight by
the boys. Some took swords, some spears,
while others bound around their waists great
belts containing daggers and knives. Old
Pluck laid hold of a huge battle-axe, while
Tomtit clapped on his head the chief’s hat, ornamented
with eagle plumes, and took into his
hand a thin, sharp rapier, the blade of which
was quite as long as himself.</p>

<p>When all were ready, the boys reëntered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
other room, and, with their weapons in their
hands, stood over the sleeping robbers. Raising
his heavy battle-axe high above the head of
the chief, Old Pluck called out to him to awake.
Instantly every man opened his eyes, and
struggled to rise. But when they found their
hands and feet were tied, and saw the boys with
their swords and spears standing over them,
and heard Old Pluck’s loud voice ordering them
not to move, every robber lay flat on his back,
and remained perfectly still.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” said Old Pluck to the chief,
“if you do not promise that you and your men
will obey me for the next two days I will split
your head with this axe.”</p>

<p>“I am willing to parley with you,” said the
chief, “and will listen to all you have to say;
but for mercy’s sake put down that battle-axe.
It is too heavy for you, and you will let it drop
on me without intending it.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Old Pluck, steadying the great
axe as well as he could, “I will hold it over you
until we have made our bargain.”</p>

<p>“Speak quickly, then,” said the chief, his
face turning pale as he looked up at the trembling
axe.</p>

<p>“All you have to do,” said Old Pluck, “is to
promise that you and your men will do everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
that we tell you to do to-morrow and
next day. You will not find our tasks at all
difficult, and it will be only for two days, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Any sort of a task, if it lasted a year,” said
the chief, “would be better than having you
staggering over me with that battle-axe. I
promise without reserve for myself and men.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” said Old Pluck, letting down
his axe as carefully as he could. “And now
we will set you free.”</p>

<p>The men were untied, and the boys went to
bed, and the next morning all breakfasted
together in the great hall. When the meal was
over the chief pushed back his chair, and addressed
the boys.</p>

<p>“Now, then, my young friends,” said he,
“what is it that you wish me and my men to
do?”</p>

<p>Then stood up Old Pluck and said, “We
boys, as I told you before, ran away from
school because we are tired of the old humdrum
Christmas; and nothing better could have
happened to us than to get you fine fellows into
our power, as we have done. It will be the
jolliest thing in the world for us to see you and
your band go through all the wild feats and
bold exploits which belong to robber life; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
we would like you to begin now, and keep it
up all day and to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“But what would you have us do?” asked
the chief, somewhat surprised.</p>

<p>“I should like to see you sack a village,”
said Old Pluck. “How would that suit you,
boys?”</p>

<p>The boys all declared that they thought that
would do very well, to begin with.</p>

<p>The chief turned to his lieutenant and said:
“Is there any village round here that has not
been recently sacked?”</p>

<p>The lieutenant reflected a moment. “There
is Buville,” he said. “We haven’t been there
for six months.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” said the captain, rising; “we’ll
sack Buville.”</p>

<p>In a short time the robber band, followed
by the eleven boys, set out for Buville, a few
miles distant. When they came within sight
of the village the chief ordered his company
to get behind a hedge which ran on one side
of the road, and thus stealthily approach the
place.</p>

<p>As soon as they were near enough the chief
gave a loud whistle, and the whole company
rushed wildly into the main street. The robbers
flashed their drawn swords in the sunlight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
and brandished their spears, while the boys
jumped and howled like so many apprentice
bandits.</p>

<p>“Buville is ours!” cried the chief. “Come
forth, ye base villagers, and pay us tribute.”</p>

<p>“Come forth!” yelled little Tomtit. “Surrender,
and trib!—I mean, pay tribute.”</p>

<p>At this the people began to flock into the
street; and presently the principal man of the
village appeared, carrying a sheet of paper and
pen and ink.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, bold sir,” he said, addressing
the chief. “And what is it you’ll have to-day?
Shall we begin with flour? How will
two barrels do?”</p>

<p>The chief nodded, and the man wrote down
on his paper two barrels of flour.</p>

<p>“Sugar, hams, and eggs, I suppose?” continued
the man.</p>

<p>The chief assented, and these were written
down.</p>

<p>“Sundry groceries, of course?” said he.
“And would you care for any rich stuffs?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that we need any just
now,” said the chief; “but you might throw in
enough gold-threaded blue taffeta to make a
jerkin for that little codger back there.”</p>

<p>“Three-quarters of a yard of blue taffeta,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
wrote the man. And then he looked up and
asked: “Anything else to-day?”</p>

<p>“I believe not,” said the chief. And then
brandishing his sword, he shouted: “Back to
your homes, base villagers, and thank your
stars that I let ye off so easily.”</p>

<p>“Home with ye!” shouted Tomtit, “and
keep on star-thanking till we come again.”</p>

<p>“You need be in no hurry about sending
those things,” said the chief to the principal
man, as he was about to leave, “except the taffeta.
I’d like to have that to-day.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” said the other; “I’ll send it
immediately.”</p>

<p>As the robbers and boys departed, the latter
were not at all slow to say that they were very
much disappointed at what they had seen. It
was tamer than a game of football.</p>

<p>“The fact is,” said the chief, “these villagers
have been sacked so often that the people are
used to it, and they just walk out and pay up
without making any row about it. It’s the
easiest way, both for them and for us; but I
admit that it is not very exciting.”</p>

<p>“I should say not,” said Old Pluck. “What
I want is ‘the wild rush and dash, the clink
and the clank, and the jingly-jank, hi-ho!’”</p>

<p>“That’s so!” shouted little Tomtit. “‘The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
clink and the clank, and the jingly-jank, ho
hi!’”</p>

<p>“I think we’ll next try a highway robbery,”
said Old Pluck, “and stop a company of travellers
on the road. That must be exciting.”</p>

<p>The boys all shouted their assent to this
plan, and the robber chief led the way to the
nearest high-road.</p>

<p>Here the whole party concealed themselves
behind rocks and bushes, and waited patiently
for a company of travellers to pass by. It was
a long, long time before anybody came, and
Tomtit had a sound nap in the shade of a
hedge.</p>

<p>At last dust was seen in the distance, and before
long five horsemen came riding up. They
were all elderly men, and each of them led a
mule or a horse, loaded with heavy panniers
and packages. With drawn swords and brandished
spears the robbers rushed out, followed
by the boys, with yells and shouts. Instantly
the elderly men stopped and descended from
their horses.</p>

<p>“We surrender,” said the leader to the robber
chief; “but we pray you will not pillage
us utterly. We are going to seek a new home
for our families, and for the money we get for
the sale of these goods we hope to buy the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
land we need. If you take these, you leave
us nothing.”</p>

<p>The chief turned to Old Pluck, and said:
“Well, what shall we do about it? Shall we
take their goods?”</p>

<p>“If you set out to do a thing,” said Old
Pluck, “I don’t see why you don’t do it.
There’s no sense in backing down.”</p>

<p>“That’s so!” cried Tomtit, who had just
wakened up, and pushed his way through the
hedge. “No backing down. Your money or
your lives, travellers. Take notice of that.”</p>

<p>“Lead away the horses and mules,” said the
chief to his men, “and let the travellers go.”</p>

<p>As they were leaving the scene of this exploit
Old Pluck did not feel altogether easy in his
mind. “There used to be a good habit among
robbers,” he said to the chief, “and that was
to give to the poor what they took from the
rich. We will go along this road until we
meet some really poor people, and we will give
them these goods.”</p>

<p>The robbers and boys, with the loaded horses
and mules, walked along the road for nearly
an hour, but met with no poor people. At last
the chief declared that it was time to turn and
go back to the castle, if they wanted to be there
by dinner-time. The boys were very willing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
to go to dinner, and the whole party retraced
their steps.</p>

<p>When they reached the spot where they had
robbed the travellers, they were surprised to
see the five elderly men sitting by the roadside,
groaning mournfully.</p>

<p>“What, here yet!” cried the chief. “What’s
the matter?”</p>

<p>“There is no use going anywhere,” sadly replied
the leader. “We have no money with
which to buy even food to eat, and no goods
to sell. We might as well die here as in any
other place.”</p>

<p>“Boys,” exclaimed Old Pluck, after gazing
a few moments on the unfortunate group, “I
don’t believe we will ever find anybody as poor
as these travellers now are. Let us give them
the goods.”</p>

<p>“All right!” shouted the boys. And the
loaded horses and mules were delivered to
their former owners.</p>

<p>After dinner the boys began to grumble a
good deal at the disappointments of the morning.</p>

<p>“We’ve done nothing yet,” cried Old Pluck,
“that is half exciting enough, and we are bound
to have a good time this afternoon. I go in for
burning a town.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“Hurrah!” said the boys. “We’ll burn a
town!”</p>

<p>“That is a very serious thing,” said the chief.
“Can’t you think of something else?”</p>

<p>Old Pluck looked at him reproachfully.
“We want something serious,” he said.
“What we’ve had so far is nothing but child’s
play.”</p>

<p>The chief now saw that if he persisted in his
objections he would hurt the feelings of the
boys, and so he consented to burn a town.
A few miles to the south there was a good-sized
town, which the chief thought would
burn very well, and thither the boys and robbers
repaired, carrying blazing torches and fire-brands.</p>

<p>When they reached the town and had made
known their purpose the people were filled
with alarm. They crowded into the streets and
begged the robbers not to burn their houses,
their goods, and perhaps themselves and their
children.</p>

<p>The chief now took the boys aside, and consulted
with them.</p>

<p>“I wish you would consider this matter a
little more before you order me to set this town
in flames. I am told that there is a magazine
filled with gunpowder in the centre of the place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
and there will be a terrible explosion when the
fire reaches it.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried the boys; “that will be
splendid.”</p>

<p>“Many of these citizens will lose their lives,”
said the chief, “and the rest will be utterly
ruined.”</p>

<p>“Now, look here,” cried Old Pluck, “there’s
no use of always backing down. I’m tired of
it.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the chief, “but you yourselves
must inform the people of your decision.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do that,” said Old Pluck. “Tomtit,
you go tell those people that the town has got
to burn, and there’s no use talking any more
about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Tomtit. “She has got to
burn.” And with his chest thrown out, and his
hands in his pockets, the little fellow boldly advanced
to the crowd of people.</p>

<p>As soon as he came near the old men, the
women and the children fell on their knees
around him, and with tears and lamentations
besought him to intercede with the robbers to
save their town. Poor little Tomtit was very
much moved by their wild grief and despair.
Tears came into his eyes, and his little chest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
heaved with emotion; but he kept up a brave
heart, and stood true to his companions.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” he said, “for you to be blubbering
and crying. Your houses have all got
to be burned up, and the powder-magazine has
got to go off with a big bang, and your furniture
and beds will all be burned, and the babies’
cradles, and—and—I’m awful sorry for
it,” and here the tears rolled down his cheeks;
“but we boys have got to stick by each other,
and you won’t have any homes, and I expect
you will all perish—boo-hoo! But it won’t do
to back down—boo-hoo-hoo! And the little
babies will die; but the old thing has got to
burn, you know.”</p>

<p>“Now, look here, Tomtit,” said Old Pluck,
who, with the rest of the boys, had drawn near,
“don’t you be too hard on these people. I say
let the town stand.”</p>

<p>The boys agreed with one voice. And Tomtit,
kicking one of his little legs above his head,
shouted in ecstasy: “Yes, sir, let the town
stand, babies and all.”</p>

<p>At this the women rushed up to the little fellow,
and, seizing him in their arms, nearly
kissed him to death.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what we are to do next,”
sadly remarked Old Pluck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“I’ll tell you,” cried Tomtit. “Let the chief
steal a bride.”</p>

<p>The whole company stopped and looked at
Tomtit. “Little boy,” said they, “what do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course,” said Tomtit, “I mean for
the chief to seize a fair damsel and carry her
off on his horse to be his bride, the wild hoofs
clattering amid the crags.”</p>

<p>“Hoot!” cried all the boys in derision. And
the chief said to Tomtit: “Little boy, I know
of no fair damsel to steal, and, besides, I do not
want a bride.”</p>

<p>“It’s pretty hard,” said Tomtit, wiping his
eyes with his little sleeve. “I’ve done just
what you fellows told me to, and now you
won’t order anything I want to see.”</p>

<p>That night the boys ordered the robbers to
hold high revels in the great hall. The flowing
bowl was passed, and the great flagons were
filled high; wild songs were sung, and the welkin
was made to ring, as well as the robbers
could do it, with jovial glee. The boys watched
the proceedings for some time, but they did
not find them very interesting, and soon went
to bed.</p>

<p>The next morning Old Pluck called a meeting
of his companions. “Boys,” he said, “this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
robber life is a good deal stupider than anything
we left behind us. Let’s get back to
school as fast as we can, and enjoy what is left
of the Christmas fun. We will all admit that
we are sorry for what we have done, and will
promise not to run away again; and Tomtit can
go to the master and tell him so.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be the first one whipped,” ruefully remarked
Tomtit; “but if you boys say so, of
course I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>The boys now took leave of the robbers,
Tomtit having been first presented with the
piece of blue taffeta to make him a jerkin.
When they reached the school Tomtit told his
tale, and he was the only one who was not punished.</p>

<p>The next year these eleven boys were leaving
school for a vacation, and on their way
home they thought they would stop and see
their old friends, the robbers. Much to their
surprise, they found everything changed at the
castle. It was now a boys’ school; the chief
was the principal, and each of the other robbers
was a teacher.</p>

<p>“You see,” said the principal to Old Pluck,
“we never knew how stupid and uninteresting
a robber’s life was until we were forced to lead
it against our will. While you were here we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
learned to like boys very much, and so we concluded
to set up this school.”</p>

<p>“Do you have Christmas trees, and carols,
and games?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” answered the principal.</p>

<p>“So do we,” said Old Pluck.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” exclaimed Tomtit, standing up
very straight. “No more fire and tribute for
us. We’ve grown out of that kind of nonsense.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> suggestions and questions are prepared to
aid the child in getting food for thought. Many
ethical questions are touched upon in these stories,
phases of the great problems of life which each
citizen must solve for himself. The school-room
is a little community, of which each child is a unit,
and there he should get training for good citizenship.
Let him grapple, then, with these questions,
for he would better be striving after a large truth
than altogether absorbing a little one.</p>


<h3>OLD PIPES AND THE DRYAD</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This story is akin to the Greek and the Latin myths, and
will lead you back to the beginnings of literature, to the
myth of Daphne and her changing to a laurel-tree, the myth
of Dryope, and Virgil’s account of the transformation of
Polydore (Æneid, Book III.)—all of which are tree-myths.
Conington’s metrical translation of Virgil tells this story very
musically.</p>

<p>These dryad stories have been the inspiration of poets and
artists of all ages. I hope you may some day see the beautiful
picture of Daphne changing to the laurel-tree that a
French artist has painted.</p>

<p>It will add much to the value of the child’s study of literature
if the teacher will read or tell these myths to the children.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
They may be found in Gayley’s “Classic Myths,”
Murray’s “Mythology,” Bulfinch’s “Mythology,” or any
classical dictionary.</p>

<p>It is easy for us to see that, in this myth of Daphne, the
Greek people were telling us, in their poetic way, that the
dawn ever flew at the sun’s approach.</p>

<p>In this story the loving helpfulness of Old Pipes brought
back his strength and youth quite as much as the kiss of the
Dryad; for are we not always strong and happy when helping others?</p>

<p>What other pieces of literature teach this lesson?</p>

<p>Read Lowell’s poem, “Rhœcus.”</p>

<p>Compare the dryad in Stockton’s story with the dryads of
the myths.</p>

<p>How do you think this idea of dryads originated?</p>

<p>Discuss the character of Old Pipes. Have you ever met
another like him in your reading?</p>

<p>Did the Dryad do right in not returning the money to the
villagers?</p>
</div>

<h3>THE BEE-MAN OF ORN</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This story can be made a starting-point for interesting
science lessons. Children can easily observe the habits of
bees. In ancient times, when honey was a staple article of
food, much was thought and written about the care of bees.
Read with the children John Burroughs’ “Birds and Bees,”
also bits from Virgil’s “Georgics,” Book IV.</p>

<p>Lead the children to discuss the following points:</p>

<p>Why did the bees not sting the Bee-Man?</p>

<p>What is it that leads animals to like a person?</p>

<p>Did his ugly appearance hinder the bees from liking the
Bee-Man? Would it hinder you from liking him?</p>

<p>Do you think the Bee-Man had flowers growing in the
little garden outside his hut?</p>

<p>What kind of flowers? Why?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>Do all flowers with perfume yield honey?</p>

<p>Which would derive more pleasure from watching the life
and habits of bees, a busy person or a lazy one?</p>

<p>Do bees make weather observations? Virgil says that
bees do not go far from the hive when an east wind is blowing.</p>

<p>What do you think was the Junior Sorcerer’s reason for
thinking the Bee-Man had been transformed?</p>

<p>Do you agree with the Junior Sorcerer in his opinion of
the Bee-Man: that he was a “miserable old man”?</p>

<p>When the Bee-Man first felt himself drawn toward the
Lord of the Domain, what was it that influenced him? Are
appearances to be trusted?</p>

<p>Do you ever meet people who, like the Languid Youth,
dislike to face duty alone, and would always rather have
someone go with them?</p>

<p>The Bee-Man shrunk from entering the cavern, yet within
it he found that phase of life toward which he was most
drawn; so the unpleasant duties of life from which we so
often shrink contain the best things that life has in store for
us.</p>

<p>Suppose the Languid Youth had found the baby in the
cavern, what would he have done?</p>

<p>If you had a chance to go back to your babyhood again,
do you think you would grow up to be the same person that
you are now?</p>

<p>Which character in this story do you like best? Why?</p>
</div>

<h3>THE CLOCKS OF RONDAINE</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This story naturally leads to the history of clocks and time-pieces
of various kinds, from the crude hour-glass, the burning
candle graduated to last a certain time, the water-clock,
much the same as the hour-glass, and the dial on which the
shadow of the sun is traced, down to the clocks which we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
have now, and especially those of finest mechanism and
beautiful ornamentation.</p>

<p>The industry of clock-making is a very important one. In
the United States it has been built up almost entirely in the
last sixty years.</p>

<p>Many years ago clock movements were made of wood;
now they are made, as every child knows, of metal, which is
cheaper to manufacture and more durable.</p>

<p>In the days of the Revolution many clocks were made in
Connecticut, using no machinery in their manufacture, but
cutting the wheels and teeth with a saw and jack-knife.
Then the makers would travel to the more recently settled
country and sell these crude wooden clocks for twenty-five
dollars apiece.</p>

<p>A description and pictures of the Strasbourg Clock could
be made interesting here.</p>

<p>In what part of the world do you think Rondaine was?</p>

<p>What characteristics should you expect to find in the people
of a town containing so many clocks?</p>

<p>What particular occupations should you expect to find
these people following?</p>

<p>For which did the people care more, clocks or time?</p>

<p>We thought, in the early part of the story, that Arla was
the only person in all Rondaine who cared to know the correct
time. Do you still think so, after finishing the story?</p>

<p>Suppose we followed the reasoning of the little old lady
with white hair, saying that what was good enough for our
grandfathers is good enough for us, how would it affect the
world?</p>

<p>Is there anything in this story that seems improbable, that
is, does it seem like a true story?</p>

<p>What truth does it leave with us?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span></p>

<h3>THE GRIFFIN AND THE MINOR CANON</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lead pupils to discuss their ideas of griffins before reading
the story.</p>

<p>To what age of literature do griffin and dragon stories
belong?</p>

<p>How could the Griffin know that the stone image was a
good likeness of himself?</p>

<p>What things do you think the Griffin told the Minor Canon
about minerals, metals, and the wonders of the world?</p>

<p>Stop at the point in the story just prior to the sending
away of the Minor Canon, and let the children discuss what
<i>they</i> would have done under those circumstances.</p>

<p>Do you agree with the Griffin in his opinion of the only
two good things in the town?</p>

<p>What did the Griffin mean when he said, “If some things
were different, other things would be otherwise”?</p>

<p>Thus we learn that goodness, bravery, and honesty, even
in a griffin, demand for companionship, goodness, bravery,
and honesty.</p>

<p>Ruskin says some very good things about dragons in the
first few pages of “The Queen of the Air.”</p>

<p>How do the things we see every day affect our characters?</p>

<p>Some very interesting and profitable comparisons may be
made between this story and Hawthorne’s story of the
“Great Stone Face”; and since comparison is such a mind-strengthener,
the teacher should never lose such an opportunity.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
